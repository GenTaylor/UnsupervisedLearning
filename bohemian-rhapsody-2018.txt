On a BLACK SCREEN - 
CAPTION: IS THIS THE REAL LIFE? 
- as we hear - the famous intro to Queen’s “WE WILL ROCK 
YOU” - BOOM-BOOM-CHA...BOOM-BOOM-CHA - both band and a huge 
stadium audience combining to beat out the anthemic 
rhythm... 
FADE IN... 
INT. FREDDIE’S GEORGIAN MANSION (GARDEN LODGE)/ LONDON - 
DAY 
This SOUND-TRACK fades away, shifting into funereal SCORE 
(”GOLDEN BOY” by FREDDIE MERCURY) as - we look down 
through a series of opened doors, toward a distant BEDROOM 
DOOR. From within, a distraught voice cries out: 
JIM HUTTON (O.S.) 
Freddie! 
The DOOR then springs open - it’s JIM HUTTON (FREDDIE’s 
long-term partner and carer) running, heart-broken, through 
the upstairs rooms of Freddie’s mansion, finally stopping 
at the top of the stairs, as - 
- the front door opens. It’s MARY AUSTIN (40) entering, 
breathless, with her own key. She looks up the stairs, at 
JIM, who is standing there, tearful, grief-stricken. 
MARY catches her breath. Her face starts to crumple as 
JIM’s expression delivers the tragic news. MARY puts down 
her bags and climbs the stairs, stopping to steady herself, 
until she and JIM hug, hold hands, then move together 
toward the distant bedroom and a big round bed lit from 
above by a column of daylight. On the bed, distantly, we 
can just make out a still FIGURE over which JIM and MARY 
bend... 
MARY 
Freddie?! Oh no, oh no! 
INT. MASKED BALL/ FREDDIE’S MANSION - NIGHT 
A gorgeous pageant of a party, in full flow - 
FREDDIE MERCURY (in a full Venetian mask and hood, his face 
concealed) enters the ROOM, at his most glorious and 
magnificent – people calling out his name - "FREDDIE!"... 
(CONTINUED)

The crowd hushes as FREDDIE passes through the crowd and 
sits at a grand piano and starts to play the intro of "It's 
A Beautiful Day"... He is joined at the piano by a masked 
female SOPRANO (Montserat Caballe?) Her unwavering, 
crystalline voice, as well as the beauty of the song, moves 
the masked guests. Song continues, over...

INT. ROGER TAYLOR’S KITCHEN/ LONDON - MORNING 
...ROGER TAYLOR (42) holding a TELEPHONE in one hand, reads 
from the DAILY MIRROR... 
ROGER 
“a man--bent--on abnormal pleasures, 
corrupt, corrupting--his life a 
revolting tale of depravity, lust 
and wickedness...” 
BRIAN 
No. 
ROGER 
“...for his kind his death--was a 
suicide.” Bastards. 
Silence - 
BRIAN 
What do you want to do? 
INT. BREAKFAST TV SHOW - DAY 
The grieving BRIAN and ROGER on a couch, face an arrogant 
MALE TV INTERVIEWER. We are live - 
INTERVIEWER 
Last week saw the death of one of the 
most flamboyant and popular figures in 
rock-music--Freddie Mercury, lead 
singer with Queen. Joining us in the 
studio to pay tribute and maybe 
reflect on Freddie’s memory for the 
first time: two of the band members: 
guitarist Brian May & drummer Roger 
Taylor--thanks for coming. So-- 
the commentators have all had their 
say about Freddie, haven’t they? 
(CONTINUED) 
3.

For ROGER and BRIAN, so full of emotion, the words don’t 
come easily... 
ROGER 
What we feel is--our friend is barely 
in his grave--all he ever did was try 
to entertain people--and some people 
are saying “good”, “good riddance”, 
“he deserved it.” It’s disgusting. 
Because he was actually - 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
(cutting him off) 
(Yes, I mean) it would be wrong not to 
say that he has been depicted in 
certain quarters as a sort of 
decadent, wild, bisexual, 
irresponsible lover. 
ROGER 
We’re here to stick up for him, coz 
he can’t stick up for himself. 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
But what was the truth of that? 
BRIAN 
Of what? 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
Was he decadent, irresponsible? When 
you hear the stories - 
BRIAN 
(reacting) 
Did he deserve to die, you mean? Is 
that the question? 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
But it’s interesting isn’t it, that - 
ROGER 
He was a victim of an epidemic. A 
plague. We lost a great artist. 
BRIAN 
And a magnificent human being. 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
And why do you think, then, some 
people are - 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED)

ROGER 
- Newspapers - let’s be clear - 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
- newspapers--the media--have reacted 
in this way? Is it perhaps because - 
ROGER 
Because they have no shame. They want 
to sell papers. They don’t know who 
he was. 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
- because Freddie became a symbol for 
a certain sort of life-style, didn’t 
he? A manifesto of hedonistic freedom. 
BRIAN and ROGER now start to become furious with this guy - 
BRIAN 
Did he? I don’t know that. 
ROGER 
You asked us on this program so we 
could talk about our friend. We 
agreed that - 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
Well let’s talk about you then, the 
band. What will you do now? Will you 
go on, or disband? 
ROGER 
It’s too soon--it’s been three days 
--we were together 22 years. We’re 
in shock, I think. 
BRIAN 
Yes. 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
Because also, well, Freddie wrote 
most of your hits--didn’t he? 
This comments stuns BRIAN and ROGER - 
ROGER 
(to BRIAN) 
Did he? Oh. 
BRIAN 
Oh so Freddie wrote: “We Will Rock 
You”--did he?

ROGER 
“A Kind of Magic”? Coz I thought - 
BRIAN 
“Radio Gaga”? (Oh I see.) 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
(Well let’s just)--just say--a lot 
of your biggest most popular hits... 
Silence, and then - 
ROGER 
No. No, let’s say--”let’s just say” 
this interview is over. Let’s just 
say that. 
(to BRIAN) 
(Shall we, dear?) 
BRIAN and ROGER get up and pull off their microphones - 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
(No, no, please), guys, hey, come on - 
ROGER 
You’re a dick. 
BRIAN and ROGER walk out. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
The year is now 2016...and in a dimly lit PRIVATE 
STUDIO...full of homely touches (furnishings, books, 
candles, and a telescope, etc) the CAMERA finds... BRIAN 
MAY (69), his back turned to camera, his curly tresses now 
GREY, wearing HEAD-PHONES (CANS), whilst playing his RED 
(”RED SPECIAL”) GUITAR. Only he can hear what he is 
playing... 
ANGLE ON: ROGER TAYLOR (67), appearing in the doorway 
behind him... 
OLDER ROGER 
Brian? BRI! 
But BRIAN can’t hear this...so ROGER throws a CUSHION. 
BRIAN turns, takes off his CANS... 
OLDER BRIAN 
Mmmmm?

OLDER ROGER 
I’m out of here. See you tomorrow 
morning. Got some good stuff. 
When ROGER departs, BRIAN pulls his HEAD-PHONES back on, 
then walks to an AMPLIFIER, tinkering with the 
knobs...until something catches his eye... 
In the doorway now stands a YOUNG MAN (early 20’s), with 
ROGER behind him. BRIAN pulls off the cans... 
OLDER ROGER 
Says he’s here for an interview. 
BLOGGER 
“BuzzMix Online”? You both agreed 
to an interview? David Ashcroft. 
OLDER BRIAN 
Buzzmix? 
BLOGGER 
Twelve million followers. 
The BLOGGER holds out his CELL-PHONE to BRIAN - BRIAN looks 
at the PHONE, reading the EMAIL... 
BLOGGER 
Email confirmation...7 pm. You 
were both “looking forward to it.” 
BRIAN passes the cell-phone to ROGER to read... 
OLDER BRIAN 
...fucking Jim Beach... 
BLOGGER 
And I fly back to the US tomorrow 
morning, so--this is really the 
only chance. Kinda--now or never. 
OLDER ROGER 
I’m good with never. 
BLOGGER 
Ha! So--it’s No? Really? I can’t 
just get you both--quick interview? 
Flew 11 hours. Hotel. Cabs...

OLDER ROGER 
I’m helluva late already, sorry. 
Would have loved to, just can’t. 
Shame, I love interviews. 
BLOGGER 
Dr May? 
OLDER ROGER 
(to BRIAN) 
Go on Doctor. Just give him--12 
minutes--a million people a minute 
aint bad. 
ROGER departs - 
OLDER BRIAN 
You give him 12 minutes! 
Silence. 
OLDER BRIAN 
I’m working. Sorry. No. 
Can you show yourself out? 
BLOGGER 
Wow. Okay. Okay--alright. Jesus. 
I’ll um--okay... 
The BLOGGER starts to go and then stops at the TELESCOPE, 
examining it. BRIAN notices and watches - 
BLOGGER 
This is an “Orion”, right? 
OLDER BRIAN 
(unimpressed) 
It’s written on the side. 
Indeed, the make “ORION” is clearly visible... 
OLDER BRIAN 
You’re interested in...(space)?

BLOGGER 
That’s the one. Anyway... 
The BLOGGER smiles, until BRIAN capitulates - 
OLDER BRIAN 
How long will it take - ? 
BLOGGER 
- Not long, not at all! See, as it’s 
the 25th anniversary Of Freddie’s 
passing there’s renewed interest, 
especially with Queen playing again... 
The BLOGGER begins to set up his TAPE RECORDER... 
BLOGGER 
...to huge crowds still--and the 
songs, they’ve endured! 
(sings badly) 
“Bismillah, we will not let you go, 
let him go...Bismillah...we will 
not let you go...” 
OLDER BRIAN 
And the press said that song should be 
“sunk to the bottom of the ocean.” 
“The Sun”, newspaper--never forget a 
bad review--nor did Freddie. Oh how 
he hated the critics. 
BLOGGER 
“Bismillah.” What is that, by the way? 
There’s all these theories out there. 
Did Freddie ever explain it? 
OLDER BRIAN 
Bismillah? 
When BRIAN NODS...the BLOGGER smiles - 
BLOGGER 
Tell me. You gotta tell me.

But BRIAN smiles wistfully, shakes his head, and waves a 
finger - 
OLDER BRIAN 
Freddie wanted mystery. He needed it, 
you see. Ask me something else. 
BLOGGER 
It’s just I did some research for this 
interview and I googled the TV 
interview you did at the time--wow, I 
mean, horrible! And you clearly wanted 
to tell people who Freddie Mercury 
really was... 
OLDER BRIAN 
And your question? 
BLOGGER 
Just that, really. Who was Freddie 
Mercury? Who was he? If we could 
start there... 
Coz, I read a bunch of stuff about 
him but none of it really made 
me any the wiser... 
The BLOGGER angles the TAPE-RECORDER MIC toward BRIAN...and 
BRIAN reluctantly sits... 
OLDER BRIAN 
Freddie?...(Frowns) Hated to talk 
about himself--well, truthfully 
about himself. 
BLOGGER 
Right! But you knew him. 
So--how did you first meet? 
Freddie Mercury? The Legend? 
OLDER BRIAN 
Bulsara. Freddie--Bulsara. 
I heard him--before I saw him...

The YOUNG BRIAN (23) and ROGER (21) walk down the halls, 
which are filled with ARTISTS plying their craft, 
sculpture, fashion, design. ROGER has two DRUM STICKS and 
drums them on whatever he passes, including the odd CUTE 
GIRL! 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Our band was good. But we were having 
problems connecting with audiences - 
INT. “SMILE” GIG - NIGHT 
SMILE perform - onstage, “Doin’ All Right”. 
BRIAN, ROGER, and BASSIST/SINGER TIM STAFFELS, in T-shirts 
and jeans, are entirely focused on playing their 
instruments - no stage presence whatsoever. 
The small AUDIENCE - of about 20 people - is appreciative. 
INT. HALLS/ EALING ART SCHOOL - DAY 
BRIAN and ROGER continue their walk through the art school. 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
We were even thinking of breaking up 
and going back to our studies...

INT. HALLS/ EALING ART SCHOOL - DAY 
ROGER and BRIAN continue their walk through ART 
SCHOOL...ROGER suddenly veering off down another corridor, 
toward the BATHROOM - BRIAN only belatedly works out where 
ROGER has gone by following the sound of DRUMMING. 
INT. BATHROOM/ EALING ART SCHOOL - DAY 
ROGER and BRIAN are now singing “TUTTI FRUTTI” (a jazzy, 
slowed-down version, harmonizing beautifully with each 
other) as ROGER, then BRIAN, go up to the urinal in the 
TILED BATHROOM with its real nice echo. 
ROGER, one handed, (one drum stick clenched in his teeth) 
still drums on the TILES as he sings (he has a very high 
sweet voice) 
ROGER/BRIAN 
“I got a girl...named Sue... 
she knows just what to doooo... 
I got a girl...named Sue... 
...she knows just what to doooo... 
As they sing and harmonise beautifully - 
- a THIRD VOICE joins them, taking the 5th part harmony - 
ROGER and BRIAN look at each other, and turn... 
VOICE 
“She rocked to the east... 
She rocked to the west... 
But she's the girrllll.... 
...that I love the best... 
The singing - which is very good - is coming from one of 
the TOILET CUBICLES. They move toward it.

The VOICE in the TOILET CUBICLE continues to sing “TUTTI 
FRUTTI” very well...as ROGER and BRIAN get down on their 
knees and peek under the door and see FEET, pointing toward 
them. Before they can get up off the floor the DOOR opens 
and the STRANGER walks past them, right over them, moving 
to the WASH-BASINS. 
ROGER and BRIAN stand and look at the STRANGER from behind, 
who is now bent over the BASIN, washing his hands as he 
continues to sing. The long-haired STRANGER is wearing SILK 
trousers, a scarf around his waist and a sheepskin 
waistcoat. Finally, the STRANGER straightens and his face 
is at last revealed in the MIRROR... 
FREDDIE

buck teeth and long black hair. He GRINS at them, via the

striking the iconic pose, eyes closed, chin raised high 
until he breaks out of it. 
REACTION, ROGER and BRIAN: Astonished... 
FREDDIE 
“Smile”! Yes? 
FREDDIE SMILES, but covers his buck teeth with his hand, 
self-consciously - the bullied little boy showing itself in 
this lingering mark of childhood insecurity.

Alright--fine--”When in England...” 
FREDDIE undoes his fly, and pulls out his PENIS, as...

can’t believe FREDDIE is standing there with his dick out. 
FREDDIE 
Don’t worry, you’re not the first 
to be speechless.

INT. FREDDIE’S BEDROOM/ BULSARA FAMILY HOME - DAY 
CLOSE ON: A RECORD - JIMI HENDRIX’S “ELECTRIC LADY LAND” - 
playing on a turn-table. 
WIDE: As BRIAN reads the sleeve notes on the ALBUM COVER - 
FREDDIE excitedly puts his EAR to the LEFT SPEAKER then 
moves to the RIGHT SPEAKER of his old STEREO RECORD 
PLAYER... 
FREDDIE 
Listen to this! Hear how the guitar 
starts here (left speaker)--here-herehere!--
and now comes over here! (right 
speaker) How does he make it do that? 
BRIAN 
Studio. They split stereo sound, two 
channels, left and right, pan back and 
forth... 
BRIAN then moves to FREDDIE’s desk, which is full of LITTLE 
PAPER BALLS, as -

BRIAN 
What’s with all the paper balls? 
CONTINUED:

BRIAN un-folds one of the balls - the title is “VAGABOND 
OUTCAST”. BRIAN looks at FREDDIE, seeing him then as FRED 
sees himself... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
“Outcast”--Yes, that’s how he’d 
always seen himself. A sad, lonely 
boy, bullied--tugged from Africa 
to India to this place--this 
little room in Feltham, Middlesex! 
FREDDIE at the full-length MIRROR, struggles to do up the 
TROUSERS...he starts to LAUGH (FREDDIE’s high GIRLISH 
LAUGH) and turns to share the joke with BRIAN - those big 
BUCK TEETH flashing for a second before FREDDIE covers them 
with his hand. BRIAN, thoughtful, smiles back... 
FREDDIE 
One has to suffer for fashion. 
BRIAN 
You write songs? 
FREDDIE 
No. That’s why they’re paper balls. 
Can’t finish them. 
BRIAN picks up a heavily marked scrap of un-balled paper, 
as FREDDIE dons a LONG BLACK COAT and covers his wardrobe 
before he EXITS. BRIAN remains - studying the scrap. 
FREDDIE’S MUM (O.S.) 
FREDDIE! 
FREDDIE (O.S.) 
I move into my first flat next week 
thank God. Smaller than this room, 
but we can hang out, play music...

Coming Ma!

Mind if I make a suggestion about

INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN crosses to the BLOGGER, with a WOODEN BOX - 
OLDER BRIAN 
Not at all proper. But a language 
that was Freddie’s own--a 
kaleidoscope of influences--a nod to 
one style, a genuflection to another-- 
melodies battling with countermelodies... 
We hear, as SOUNDTRACK, these layers of sound, these 
elements, building up...up...as - BRIAN opens the BOX. 
Inside it, LITTLE PAPER BALLS. 
OLDER BRIAN 
...rock competing with “Uncle Mack’s 
Children’s Favourites”, competing with 
Mantovani--the Laughing Policeman with 
Verdi and the Billy Goats Gruff. And 
what I saw, in these little bits of 
paper, this confetti - was a man's 
confusion--in musical form--about who 
he was! A many of strange parts. And 
such--cacophany! 
BRIAN playfully covers his ears as the noise he hears gets 
too much. And then the CACOPHONY on the SOUNDTRACK suddenly 
stops - SILENCE. 
OLDER BRIAN 
And what could I do for him? Connect 
them all, help him to tie them 
together, to produce...harmony. 
BRIAN picks up his “RED SPECIAL GUITAR” 
OLDER BRIAN 
Let me show you! In those days--he 
was writing things--like this...

PIANO RIFF of “SEVEN SEAS OF RHYE”...

FREDDIE, playing the PIANO RIFF on the FAMILY PIANO -

asked me “What goes now?”

And I said...I said “It goes - 
BRIAN raises his arms as we hear - BANGGGG! a huge CHORD of 
MULTI-TRACKED GUITARS with DRUMS... 
OLDER BRIAN 
MASSIVE...three guitars in harmony! 
Guitars transformed into an 
orchestra! I could give him what 
he was hearing but couldn’t play. 
Another BANGGG! of HUGE GUITARS and then FREDDIE’s voice 
comes in with the first lyric... 
OLDER BRIAN 
And then we’re in. 
BRIAN silences, with a snap of his fingers, the music. 
But the BLOGGER is more interested in the guitar itself.

FREDDIE 
Ready Steady Go.

Wait, wait--This--give me---Bloody-

won’t go back into the bottom half -

FREDDIE will just use the top half of the MIC stand, the 
MIC affixed. FREDDIE comes to the centre of the stage. 
For a second FREDDIE stares at the audience, the shy 
nervous Farouk Bulsara. But then he takes a deep breath and 
nods at BRIAN, who counts in the BAND - 
“SMILE” strike up the intro to “Doin’ All Right” - and 
FREDDIE jumps into a dramatic pose, which he holds like a 
statue - 
BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN all share surprised looks as 
FREDDIE then begins to TRANSFORM THE SONG - his hugely 
dramatic and showy performance a million miles from what we 
saw Tim Staffel do with it. 
ANGLE ON: The Audience reaction: Startled. 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Same old song, but it sure felt 
different with Freddie doing it. 
INT. BIBA CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - DAY 
A trendy clothes boutique - 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...and it needed a new look. 
CLOSE ON: MARY AUSTIN (19), who works in the store. 
BRIAN 
This is Freddie. 
FREDDIE, a gentleman, proffers his hand - 
FREDDIE 
How do you do? 
BRIAN 
Mary. Mary Austin. 
FREDDIE 
Mary. 
MARY 
Freddie. 
They smile at each other. 
MARY 
So how do you know Brian? 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED)

FREDDIE 
I’m his new lead singer. 
BRIAN nods. 
MARY 
(unimpressed) 
Oh yeah? 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON: BRIAN’s FINGERNAILS - now varnished WHITE. 
WIDE: BRIAN and FREDDIE and ROGER (ROGER has a less overthe-
top wardrobe than the others) are looking through the 
clothing racks - while MARY speaks with another customer. 
FREDDIE keeps sneaking glances at her - 
FREDDIE 
(aside to BRIAN, re 
MARY) 
Details! She’s your girlfriend? 
Not your girlfriend? What? C’mon. 
BRIAN 
Sort of. 
FREDDIE 
Sort of Yes, or sort of No? 
BRIAN 
Sort of--both. We’ve been out a few 
times. It was - 
FREDDIE 
Kissed her? 
BRIAN 
Cheek only. Look, if you like her-- 
then just--she’s had a rough time with 
guys. Needs someone to appreciate her. 
FREDDIE 
There’s something really sweet and 
calming about her. 
BRIAN 
Go on then--ask her out. 
FREDDIE looks at MARY, who sees him looking, and he - shyly 
pretends to go through more clothes. 
CUT TO: 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
21.

LATER. MARY shows out the last shopper and turns to see 
FREDDIE, the last one in the store - BRIAN and ROGER are 
gone, and FREDDIE is still pretending to go through the 
clothes. 
ANGLE ON: FREDDIE, his eye momentarily taken by a HANDSOME 
YOUNG MAN, who glances at FREDDIE, before leaving the 
store. FREDDIE watches him go, with as yet unadmitted 
sexual interest, as - 
MARY 
Closing. 
MARY is standing right behind him. Conflicted, he manages- 
MARY 
Find anything? 
FREDDIE 
Might need something...louder. 
MARY 
You really like clothes. 
FREDDIE 
Fashion & Design, Ealing Arts. 
(holds wide his arms) 
Can’t you tell? 
MARY 
I can now. Yes. 
A spark passes between, as FREDDIE tries to pluck up the 
courage - 
- and as MARY notices that FREDDIE’s FINGERNAILS are 
varnished BLACK. 
FREDDIE 
So--right. See you. Some other time. 
He leaves, but then returns - 
FREDDIE 
It’s some other time. 
She smiles at him - he’s CHARMING. 
EXT. KENSINGTON MARKET - DAY 
FREDDIE and ROGER work their little STALL, trying to sell 
FREDDIE’s ART-WORK (drawings of JIMI HENDRIX, ROCK HUDSON)

Right now, no buyers...And then, through the crowd, comes 
MARY - 
FREDDIE picks up a VENETIAN MASK and holds it over his 
face. 
MARY 
“Smile”. 
ROGER 
If we could find a customer. 
MARY 
I just had people in the store talking 
about this wild new band. It’s going 
well.
(to Freddie) 
And who might this be? 
FREDDIE 
Countessa! Might I perchance interest 
you in my bric a brac? A portrait 
perhaps of our Saviour, James Hendrix 
rendered by own hand? 
MARY 
Actually, I was looking for Fred. 
FREDDIE 
(to ROGER) 
Fred? 
ROGER 
Could you describe him? 
MARY 
With some difficulty. 
FRED slides the MASK down...and then starts to sing... 
FREDDIE 
“He’s so nervous...but he’s at your 
service...” 
MARY 
(smiling) 
Hello 
FREDDIE 
Hello. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
23.

ROGER sees that these two are smitten with each other. 
CUT TO: 
With MARY, FREDDIE buys an old damaged PIANO, paying CASH, 
but is a little short and so whispers to MARY, who has to 
open her PURSE and contribute...FREDDIE smiles at the PIANO 
SELLER over this... 
CUT TO: 
MARY and he watch the PIANO being loaded into a truck. 
FREDDIE 
Rightio. We need to stop by a 
chemist and buy some 
nail-polish immediately. 
MARY 
Why? 
FREDDIE 
Why do you think? 
INT. FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT/ 2 VICTORIA RD/ LONDON - DAY 
CLOSE ON: The BRUSH of the BLACK-FINGERNAIL painting 
BLACK NAIL-POLISH onto - the White Piano Keys. 
WIDE: We are in the tiny new flat Freddie has just rented 
– empty but for the piano. While he paints the White Keys 
BLACK...MARY paints the black keys WHITE... 
FREDDIE 
Let's make the poor little thing 
stand out...transform it, from 
being just another sad, completely 
forgettable, run of the mill... 
two-a-penny...humdrum... 
MARY 
...garden variety... 
FREDDIE 
...bog-standard... 
MARY 
...middle of the road... 
FREDDIE 
...a So-So piano--and make it 
one-of-a-kind. Famous among pianos.

MARY 
Famous among pianos? 
He steals a kiss on her CHEEK - 
FREDDIE 
There. 
MARY 
Oh. 
She then leans forward and kisses him on the LIPS. When she 
stops - 
FREDDIE 
Oh. 
Keeping his eyes locked on her, he blindly plays a few 
cheerful notes on the PIANO, which makes her smile. 
CUT TO: 
They have just finished making love, on the floor. He 
kisses her body with little love-pecks - 
FREDDIE 
So what are your parents like? (kiss) 
MARY 
(giggles) 
That tickles! 
FREDDIE 
Completely normal I suppose? (kiss) 
MARY 
Garden Variety. Freddie! (stop) 
FREDDIE 
Run Of The Mill? (kiss) 
MARY 
(suddenly serious) 
Two. A-penny. 
INT. AUSTIN FAMILY HOME - DAY 
LUNCH. While they eat, MARY communicates with her parents - 
both are MUTE and DEAF and communicate in sign language 
with MARY. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
25.

Tense silence. FREDDIE seems nervous, shy. His FINGERS, on 
the table, TAP OUT PIANO NOTES on an imaginary keyboard... 
MARY’s PARENTS both notice that FREDDIE’s tapping fingernails 
are painted BLACK. 
FREDDIE 
(whispers) 
They’re deaf and mute? 
MARY 
(to FREDDIE) 
I just told them your life story. 
Well, the little I know of it! 
FREDDIE smiles at her parents, who smile back. 
FREDDIE 
Tell them it’s nice to meet them. 
MARY 
I have. 
FREDDIE 
Okay. Then, uh--thank them for 
the delicious food. 
MARY 
I have. 
FREDDIE 
Then--I dunno, then tell them their 
daughter is a tremendous fuck. 
MARY 
They can lip read. 
BOOM. FREDDIE’s heart stops - mortified! 
REACTION MARY’s PARENTS: outrage. 
FREDDIE 
You’re joking? 
MARY 
Uh-uh. 
FREDDIE 
Oh God. 
FREDDIE lowers his head, trying to eat.

FREDDIE 
(to her parents) 
Great food. 
EXT. LONDON STREETS/ FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT - DAY 
FREDDIE, HAPPY, hurries up the street and climbs the steps 
to a front door, humming a TUNE, lighting a CIGARETTE. 
INT. STAIRS/ FREDDIE FIRST FLAT - DAY 
FREDDIE runs up the stairs - humming the TUNE - 
INT. FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT/ LONDON - DAY 
FREDDIE opens the door to his FLAT, and is surprised to see 
- 
- MARY, in their new bed, drowsily waking. (The PIANO 
serves as the bed’s HEADBOARD) 
FREDDIE 
Dearie! Still in bed? Perfect. Stay 
right - 
FREDDIE peels off his shirt, kicks off his shoes, and then 
takes another HIT on his CIGARETTE... 
FREDDIE 
- where - you are. 
MARY 
I loathe that you’ve started smoking. 
FREDDIE 
I need more gravel in my voice. The 
top guys now all sound asthmatic. 
FREDDIE stops at the full-length mirror - 
FREDDIE 
(touches his hair) 
Why is my hair always greasy? 
MARY 
It’s not. I need to get up. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
27.

FREDDIE 
No. The new rule for our new life 
together: we have to make love at 
least four times a day whether we want 
to or not. And this number 
can be changed, but only increased. 
He bounds into bed. 
FREDDIE 
And you will want to, won’t you? 
You’ll always want to? 
MARY 
Always? (Playfully uncertain) Probably. 
FREDDIE 
Probably?! You little Nun! You 
little convent Nun! 
She giggles as he tickles and kisses her - 
MARY 
Are all men as - 
FREDDIE 
- as what? 
MARY 
Your libido is - 
FREDDIE 
- We’re lucky, aren’t we? It’s just 
a gift we both have to be grateful 
for. It astonishes me too. 
He kisses her bust and she playfully pushes him away until 
their eyes lock and they start to kiss passionately, and 
make love - MARY moving on top of him, happily. Until - 
FREDDIE 
Wait! 
MARY 
(concerned) 
What? What is it? 
FREDDIE stares at her, his eyes wide (is he in pain?) and 
then - without raising his head from the pillow - reaches - 
with his right hand, up and behind him - for the PIANO 
keys... 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
28.

FREDDIE 
Wait. Wait... 
Lying there, he BLINDLY plays a few notes on the PIANO... 
(We start to recognise the TUNE as the opening bars of what 
will eventually be BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY) He likes what he 
hears, as his face breaks into a smile. 
FREDDIE 
What do you think? 
MARY 
Freddie! 
FREDDIE 
It’s good, don’t you think?! I’m 
writing a song. If Brian and Roger can 
do it I should be able to. And this 
tune keeps going round and round and 
round in my head- Bom Bom... 
Bom,Bom,Bom,Bom...but I can’t finish 
it. Do you think it has potential? 
MARY 
(insulted) 
Freddie - 
FREDDIE 
How beautiful you are. 
They start to kiss and MAKE LOVE again but, as he caresses 
her with his LEFT HAND, his RIGHT HAND sneaks back up to 
the keys and plays the opening phrase of the TUNE. 
MARY 
Freddie! You’re awful! 
FREDDIE 
Wait, wait, wait--what do you think 
of it? It’s charming, don’t you 
think? It’s like a cowboy song. 
MARY 
I give up! 
She jumps out of bed. 
FREDDIE 
Mary! Come back here this instant! 
MARY slams the bathroom door. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
29.

FREDDIE 
Mary?! 
He then lies back and reaches up with BOTH HANDS and plays 
blindly - even more recognizably - the opening bars of 
BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. He tries now to hum a melody over it - 
FREDDIE 
Hmmm-Hmmm....Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm 
(breaking) 
Mary? 
(sings) 
“Mama”...Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm. 
FREDDIE gives up, looks down, notices he has an erection, 
as MARY exits the BATHROOM, heading for the KITCHEN. 
FREDDIE 
Mary?! Uh Oh! It’s happening again! 
MARY (O.S.) 
Use the bathroom! 
He gets out of bed, adjusting himself - 
FREDDIE 
The bathroom?!! The bathroom?!! 
FREDDIE exits the BEDROOM, hunting MARY, and we promptly 
hear (O.S.) HAPPY SQUEALS from MARY... 
MARY 
Stay away! Freddie! Arrhh! Stay away! 
Help! Help! 
INT. BULSARA HOME - DAY 
LUNCH. It’s FREDDIE’s BIRTHDAY. A far noisier affair than 
the Austin’s. Everyone is wearing paper party hats. 
FREDDIE is dressed VERY CONSERVATIVELY - playing the role 
of the good son. 
MARY meets FREDDIE’s boisterous family, and sees the love 
they all have for him. 
FREDDIE’S MUM 
No, Farrokh was born in Zanzibar. 
FREDDIE 
(cringing) 
Ma! None of that old stuff! 
CONTINUED: (3) 
(CONTINUED) 
30.

Even here, FREDDIE is nervous, TAPPING his FINGERS, playing 
that PHANTOM PIANO. 
FREDDIE’S MUM 
What? 
MARY notes that - FREDDIE’s tapping FINGERNAILS are no 
longer PAINTED BLACK - He’s hiding his true nature from 
those who love him most. 
MARY 
(at FREDDIE) 
Farrokh? 
FREDDIE shrugs at the revelation of this family secret, as - 
his MUM comes to the table with a STACK of FAMILY PHOTOS 
and starts passing them to MARY... 
FREDDIE’S MUM 
His father and I are Indian Parsees. 
FREDDIE 
Can we please talk about something 
else? I’m serious! 
MARY 
(to FREDDIE’s DAD) 
Fred said you were Persian. 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
(defensively) 
A thousand years ago the 
Parsees came out of Persia 
to escape Muslim 
persecution... 
FREDDIE 
(singing) 
La da da da da da da da da 
da dada dadadada... 
FREDDIE’s sister passes bread to MARY - 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
...and what’s a thousand years 
between friends, right Fred? 
FREDDIE scowls at KASHMIRA, as - 
- MARY shows FREDDIE a PHOTO of a 10 YEAR OLD FARROKH, in 
a village in ZANZIBAR, grinning with BUCK TEETH... 
MARY 
Sweet. 
FREDDIE winces as he snatches the PHOTO away from MARY. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
31.

KASHMIRA BULSARA 
What?! What are you so 
embarrassed about?! 
FREDDIE 
Kash! WHY DON’T YOU JUST - 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
Both of you!!!
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
Freddie was born in England at the 
age of 18. 
FRED’s DAD shows MARY then FRED a PHOTO of YOUNG FREDDIE in 
BOXING GLOVES... 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
Was a good boxer actually. 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
He had to be! 
FREDDIE can take no more of this and bounces over to the 
FAMILY PIANO, and starts to bash on the keys - 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
(aside, to MARY) 
But his opponents went for his teeth. 
FREDDIE 
“Happy Birthday to Me...Happy 
Birthday to Me...” 
(switching to the 
style of Marilyn 
Monroe) 
“Happy Birthday Mr Fred-isent, 
Happyyyy... 
(and then a segue) 
“Get Back, Get back, Get back to 
where you once belonged!...’ 
(segue) 
“For once in my life I have someone 
who needs me, someone I’ve waited 
so long...” 
FREDDIE winks at MARY, but MARY - serious-faced - perceives 
FREDDIE’s game, that he’s hiding his biography from her. 
She then notes that the FAMILY are delighted by FREDDIE’s 
pantomime... 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
Elvis! Elvis!

FREDDIE 
“...Was a cold and grey Zanzibarian 
morn, and another little chil’...” 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
Acker Bilk! 
FREDDIE 
Oh shit...umm...uhhh... 
(and then remembers) 
FREDDIE slips into “Stranger On The Shore” and, as he 
plays, BLOWS - with pursed lips - the CLARINET part, which 
gets the whole family La-la-laing the lilting melody... 
MARY finally smiles at this balmy family. 
FREDDIE then slams shut the lid of the PIANO. 
FREDDIE 
There! Concert over. 
FREDDIE’s DAD picks up where they left off, handing another 
PHOTO to MARY - 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
And this is Farrokh at boarding 
school in Bombay... 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
(to MARY) 
All on his own. Poor Farrokh - 
FREDDIE explodes - 
FREDDIE 
FREDDIE! My name is Freddie! My 
name--is FREDDIE...MERCURY. 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
Freddie what? 
FREDDIE 
My stage name. My new stage name. 
FREDDIE’S MUM 
Well you’re not on stage now Farrokh. 
FREDDIE 
Freddie Mercury! I am a professional 
singer and that is now my name from 
now on, anywhere, anytime, even here!

Stunned silence, then - 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
You want your own family--to call 
you Freddie Mercury? 
FREDDIE 
From now on. 
FREDDIE’S MUM 
Freddie Mercury? What is this? 
(to MARY) 
What is wrong with Farrokh? With 
Bulsara? 
FREDDIE 
What’s wrong with it is... 
he doesn’t exist anymore! 
He resumes eating. The FAMILY and MARY stare at him. The 
FAMILY finally resuming eating as well - accepting this. 
INT. ZANDRA RHODES’ CLOTHING STORE - DAY 
ROGER comes out of the DRESSING ROOM - in a full GLAM 
OUTFIT. 
Designer, Zandra Rhodes, nods with approval as - a second 
later, another curtain parts, and BRIAN comes out in 
another GLAM OUTFIT, complete with a WING-SHIRT. A second 
later, and JOHN comes out in a THIRD COSTUME - and finally 
FREDDIE - only FREDDIE looks happy. 
FREDDIE 
I feel like a butterfly! 
ROGER 
I feel like a tosser. 
We’re musicians. We’re not actors. 
FREDDIE 
It’s outrageous--that’s the only way 
the public will realise you’re on the 
scene! Rock has to be a show! 
Look at Hendrix. You saw him perform? 
BRIAN performs a LICK of AIR-GUITAR - we actually HEAR the 
LICK (intro to “VOODOO CHILD”) as SOUNDTRACK... 
FREDDIE 
It’s a show! Jimi lets the audience 
in!

BRIAN 
Muddy Waters just sits in a chair. 
FREDDIE shoots BRIAN an “Et tu Brute” look. 
JOHN’s costume is too tight for him - 
JOHN 
Is breathing allowed? 
FREDDIE 
And the band needs to change its 
name. “SMILE” is limp. We deserve 
something--regal... 
INT. ROLLER SKATING RINK/ UK CONCERT 2 - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON: The BASS DRUM, sporting it’s new LOGO - 
QUEEN 
QUEEN play...”STEP ON ME”...but now for disinterested 
ROLLER-SKATERS, going round and round. The BAND looks 
ridiculous in their new ZANDRA RHODES COSTUMES. When the 
song ends they are approached by the RINK MANAGER... 
RINK 
You guys finished? 
ROGER 
No. We’ve just started. 
RINK 
Coz they (the skaters) want some 
disco, you know how ‘tis. Do you 
play disco then? No? 
FREDDIE 
I fucking hate disco. 
RINK 
Then if you don’t mind, I’m just 
going to put on some disco records, 
keep ‘em happy, rightio? 
The BAND stand there, stunned, as cheap DISCO comes over 
the TANNOY. The SKATERS go round and round.

BRIAN finishes lighting a CANDELABRA, touching a match to 
the last THREE wicks... 
OLDER BRIAN 
Those first three albums? We had 
small hits. “My Fairy King”. 
Freddie’s. It starts--it starts 
(blows out the match) 
...in descending lines... 
As he mimes (AIR-GUITAR) playing the first notes, we hear 
these notes as SOUNDTRACK... 
OLDER BRIAN 
But then? I took the reels on 
the tape deck, turned them over, 
played the tape backwards... 
He mimes again, and we hear the same notes in reverse, as a 
RISING SCALE now... 
OLDER BRIAN 
You see? “Backwards guitars”...so 
rising now...in three-part harmony... 
...eight bars...then the drums! 
(the drums kick in) 
Little Richard suddenly! Jerry Lee! 
Vocal harmonies... 
(the vocals kick in) 
...Soaring, impossibly high! 
(the vocals go even 
higher) 
Bending harmonies--another 
trademark--and then - 
He mimes the little LEAD GUITAR FILL that bridges the next 
section - as we hear the SONG switch - 
OLDER BRIAN 
- a nursery rhyme! What next?

worth...34, 42... 
FREDDIE 
Is this the most intellectual rockband 
the world has ever seen? 
JOHN 
Certainly the best spellers. 
BRIAN

almost dandyish, smiling, JOHN REID, among photos of his 
other client, ELTON JOHN...

JOHN REID 
Let’s change the world. 
QUEEN also shake the hand of PAUL PRENTER, Reid’s mustached 
assistant... 
JOHN REID 
Paul Prenter--he’ll be assisting 
me with day-to-day. 
INT. RAY FOSTER’S OFFICE/ EMI RECORDS - DAY 
CLOSE: on JOE BASTIN, a handsome record executive of 
FREDDIE’s age. 
RAY FOSTER (O.S.) 
So. A new album? 
ANGLE ON: FREDDIE, taking a clear interest in JOE BASTIN - 
JOHN REID (O.S.) 
Their biggest and best yet - 
RAY FOSTER (O.S.) 
And most expensive I presume. 
FREDDIE finally concentrates on what EMI BOSS, RAY FOSTER, 
has to say... 
AT FOSTER’s side stand JOE BASTIN and his FINANCIAL 
OFFICER. They face - 
- JOHN REID, PAUL PRENTER and QUEEN. 
RAY FOSTER 
Well I need not tell you--that it’s 
make or break time. I think you have 
to agree we have been patient with 
you, hoping for a breakthrough that 
I’m afraid just hasn’t come. 
JOHN REID 
Yet. 
FREDDIE 
I want you to hear something. 
It’s the new concept. 
FREDDIE goes to the record player and slips on an ALBUM. 
Meanwhile BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN exchange nervous looks. 
RAY FOSTER looks to his advisors, who shrug. The MUSIC 
comes on - They all listen. It’s OPERA. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
41.

RAY FOSTER 
It’s--opera. 
FINANCIAL OFFICER 
It’s opera. 
JOHN REID 
Opera. 
ROGER 
Seems to be an echo in here. 
FREDDIE 
Wait! 
FREDDIE, as if conducting the orchestra, thrills to a 
particular passage (a coloratura) in the music - singing 
along with it - 
FREDDIE 
You see?! 
REACTIONS ROGER, BRIAN, JOHN - nervous about how this is 
going down. 
RAY FOSTER looks simply confused, as FREDDIE turns off the 
music. 
FREDDIE 
(quietly) 
That’s our concept--mix genres, no 
boundaries, dare to go anywhere. I 
can’t think of anyone whose ever done 
that before. 
RAY FOSTER 
Precisely what worries me. 
FREDDIE 
I don’t want us to repeat ourselves. 
The same formula, over and over--How 
boring! We want to capture a 
hurricane! Paint pictures on an 
enormous scale, heavy rock foundation, 
ethereal vocals, different voices, 
rhythms, keys. Deafen ‘em, blind ‘em, 
and leave ‘em wanting more. 
We want to make the greatest fucking 
album ever made. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
42.

RAY FOSTER 
Really? Trouble is, Freddie, that’s 
exactly what every band who comes in 
here says - minus the “fucking”. 
(beat) 
Because it’s our feeling, here at EMI, 
that your biggest success was “Killer 
Queen”, and it’s that we’d like to see 
you get back to. 
FREDDIE 
Go backwards? It’s not in our nature. 
You want us to go back? 
RAY FOSTER 
Not necessarily back, no. You stay 
here, we want you right here--just-- 
bring sound...forward. 
The BAND stare at FOSTER - not buying it. 
FINANCIAL OFFICER 1 
We really need a firm undertaking to 
that effect. John? If we are to take 
the risk one more time. 
JOHN REID looks at the band, and then nods - 
JOHN REID 
I understand what you’re saying. 
FREDDIE glares at JOHN REID for this. 
FEATHERSTONE 
So--we are agreed? An album--in the 
vein of “Killer Queen”? Radiofriendly? 
Top of The Pops?...Good? 
Silence from the BAND, until - 
JOHN REID 
Absolutely. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
JOHN REID and PAUL PRENTER stand and toast their deal, but 
QUEEN, very GLUM, refuse to stand, or join the toast. 
JOHN REID 
To your fourth album! Come on guys! 
You got your fourth album! 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
43.

PAUL PRENTER 
Fourth album! 
JOHN REID 
We just need 12 great new “Killer 
Queens.” Get writing. All of you. 
ROGER, BRIAN, FREDDIE and JOHN just stare at him. 
FREDDIE 
Boredom--is a disease--the biggest 
disease in the world, darling--and 
we’ve just agreed to spread it! 
Cheers! To Boredom! 
FREDDIE raises his glass - and turns to the EMI EXECUTIVES 
across the room - 
JOHN REID 
Freddie--I’m giving Paul to you. 
Personal assistant. Take some pressure 
off. And keep you out of trouble. 
A good influence. 
FREDDIE 
Oh I have a good influence. I have 
Mary. 
JOHN REID 
You will still have Mary. Now you 
have Paul as well. It’s a gift. 
JOHN, ROGER and BRIAN all observe this - 
FREDDIE 
Oh well. 
FREDDIE and PAUL shake hands. 
ANGLE ON: BRIAN watching - suspicious - 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
In hindsight, if there was a moment 
I should have intervened... 
FREDDIE and PAUL smile at each other. 
FREDDIE 
I suppose the more the merrier. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
44.

OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...I was worried but I didn’t have 
the audacity to tell him what to do. 
I said--nothing. 
CUT TO: 
Later - REID and QUEEN confer - 
JOHN REID 
Royalties, profits. How do you want 
to cut up the pie? How have you 
traditionally done that? 
ROGER 
What pie? 
JOHN has the best business head - 
JOHN 
The songwriter--whoever brings a 
song in - even if we all contribute - 
- gets the song-writing credit for 
that song. And if the song gets on 
the album, then that person gets 
the publishing royalties. The rest of 
the band gets - 
ROGER 
- what’s left over. 
JOHN 
Brian, now Freddie, are writing 
most of the songs, so... 
JOHN REID 
And you don’t want to pool the 
money, divide it evenly? 
A KEY moment for the band - they look at each other for the 
longest time... 
BRIAN 
I think--we’re good with the 
current arrangement. 
FREDDIE 
It’s working. 
REID looks at ROGER and JOHN, who swallow their nascent 
dissatisfaction with this. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
45.

JOHN REID 
Yes? We’re all good? Speak now...? 
Then I’ll draw something up. 
CUT TO: 
FREDDIE (sitting with JOHN REID)... 
JOHN REID 
You’re happy? Being in a band? 
FREDDIE 
Sure. 
JOHN REID 
Ever think of going solo? 
FREDDIE 
No. 
FREDDIE glances over at JOE BASTIN, who smiles at FREDDIE 
while raising his GLASS. FREDDIE, nervously, smiles back, 
raises his glass, ever careful not to bare his TEETH. 
JOHN REID notices this exchange between the two men - and 
it appears to trouble him... 
JOHN REID 
I hope you don’t mind but I need 
you to know something. 
(beat) 
I’m gay. 
FREDDIE just stares at John, and says nothing. 
FREDDIE 
Really? 
FREDDIE looks at his friends, anxiously: Do they know about 
him also? 
FREDDIE 
Have you told the others? 
JOHN REID 
I think they know. 
(pointedly) 
People generally do. 
REACTION FREDDIE: Concern - has JOHN REID detected his true 
nature?

INT. FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT/ LONDON - NIGHT 
Fred gives MARY a PRESENT. 
MARY 
What is it? 
FREDDIE 
Go on, open it up! 
MARY opens the box and inside is another box. She opens 
this second box only to discover, inside, a third...and so 
on... 
MARY 
Oh no. 
FREDDIE 
Getting smaller and smaller, I’m 
afraid. Shrinking and shrinking, 
sorry sweetie.
MARY 
What is it? 
FREDDIE 
Well it can’t be very big! 
(watching her) 
Be more fun if the boxes got bigger 
and bigger, wouldn’t it and you end 
up with a car or something. 
Finally MARY takes out a RING-BOX, and opens it. Inside is 
a RING. She stares at him - stunned. 
FREDDIE 
Well? 
MARY 
Which hand? 
FREDDIE 
Left hand, fourth finger. 
Her heart stops. 
FREDDIE 
Your turn to say something. 
MARY 
(moved) 
Yes. Of course. 
(CONTINUED) 
47.

They kiss. 
FREDDIE 
That’s alright then. Isn’t it? 
She nods, moved, looking at her RING. FREDDIE watches her, 
warmly - but conflicted. 
EXT. ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
CHICKENS and COWS cross the FARMYARD. A working DAIRY FARM. 
ANGLE ON: QUEEN, standing with their gear, at the gates, in 
the mud, uncertain if this was a good idea. 
ROGER 
Nice recording studio. 
JOHN 
Evidently the cheapest EMI could find. 
BRIAN 
The idea was to get away from all 
distractions. 
FREDDIE 
You forgot cow shit and roosters 
at dawn. 
The FARMER comes out to greet them. 
FARMER 
“Queen” I presume?! Welcome! Shall 
we get you settled in then? 
The BAND cross the YARD. FREDDIE, playfully, chases a 
CHICKEN that SQUARKS and FLAPS away. 
FARMER 
Only two of the rooms have windows! 
This makes BRIAN and JOHN dash indoors to grab them - 
leaving FREDDIE and ROGER the last to enter the FARMHOUSE. 
ROGER 
Engaged? Congratulations’n all that. 
Ra Ra, very cool. 
FREDDIE 
Surreal you mean. You and Dominique? 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED)

ROGER 
(cautionary) 
Ah ah ah ah! Every man, in their own 
time, in their own way. 
WIDE SHOT of the YARD. 
MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
THE YARD - LATER. ROGER now CHATS-UP a FARM-GIRL (who 
holds an URN of MILK) as the sound of BRIAN’s GUITAR 
(playing ROCK CHORDS - not yet a memorable riff) emanates 
from the open windows. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
BLOGGER 
Was there creative conflict? During 
those sessions?
OLDER BRIAN 
Conflict? No, I don’t think so. No. 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO /ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
FREDDIE, ROGER, BRIAN and JOHN are shouting at the same 
time - ROGER’s VOICE breaks through. 
ROGER 
I put my heart and soul into this 
song and you don’t like it because 
you want your songs on the album 
and your royalties as writers-- 
that’s why you don’t like it!!! 
FREDDIE 
For God’s sake. It’s not that, Roger 
dear - 
ROGER 
OH REALLY?! THEN WHAT IS IT?! 
Only BRIAN is brave enough to say it - 
BRIAN 
(picking up the lyric 
sheet) 
“I’m In Love With My Car”? It’s not 
strong enough. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
49.

ROGER 
Not strong enough? 
BRIAN 
No. John? Fred? Is it strong enough? 
If I’m on my own here... 
JOHN and FRED prefer not to say... 
ROGER 
How fucking dare you! Oh! How does 
your song go? “You call me 
sweet...like I'm some kind of cheese” 
Fucken Yeats! But did you hear me 
(criticizing) - 
BRIAN 
(No, but you -) No, but you made it 
very clear! Playing your drums out 
of time! 
ROGER 
I never play out of time! 
I can’t play out of time! 
BRIAN 
Way out of time, smashing your highhat 
- 
ROGER 
Sometimes I could fucking murder you 
May! 
FREDDIE 
Let’s be honest--we could all 
fucking murder each other! (So let’s 
just -) 
BRIAN 
You know why you’re angry? Because 
you know your song isn’t strong 
enough! 
JOHN knows BRIAN has gone too far. FREDDIE too, winces, 
anticipating what is to come... 
ROGER looks at BRIAN - then GOES to a SHELF holding 
CASSETTE TAPES. He pulls it over - CRASH! 
ROGER 
Is that strong enough?! 
ROGER then PUSHES over his DRUM-SET - CRASH! 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
50.

ROGER 
That strong enough?! 
ROGER then picks up the COFFEE MACHINE...the BAND react as 
one: 
BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE/ROY 
NOT THE COFFEE MACHINE! 
ROGER stares at them, the COFFEE MACHINE held aloft. 
FREDDIE 
Fuck this. 
FREDDIE walks out... 
INT. TACK-ROOM/ ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
FREDDIE wanders in to the RIDING-GEAR STORAGE ROOM and 
sees, to his surprise, behind HAY BALES, an OLD PIANO. He 
moves the top BALE aside and uses the remaining one as a 
PIANO STOOL. He tests the keys - a little out of tune in 
the uppermost keys... 
FREDDIE 
Oh dear. 
IN FRUSTRATION, he bangs out a few dumb cords and then 
stops - thinks a moment - what shall he play? He sighs, 
alone in this little shed, letting all the TENSION out of 
himself, trying to rid himself off all the shit that is 
weighing him down... 
FREDDIE 
(to himself) 
Come on Freddie... 
He flexes his FINGERS, looks at the keys and then sets his 
FINGERS on the keys...trying to recall an old half-written 
piece...the opening “MAMA” part from BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY... 
FREDDIE 
How does it go? 
(plays a few notes) 
...it goes it goes it goes... 
He remembers, and plays the opening bars beautifully on the 
BROKEN PIANO. Pausing again - he recalls the lyrics...then 
plays again, but singing now, clear, high, clean, 
emotional... 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
51.

FREDDIE 
“Mama...I just killed a man - “ 
He pauses, reflecting, with strong emotion, on the meaning 
of this line... 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
(singing) 
- “Put a gun against his head, 
pulled my trigger now he’s dead.” 
(beat) 
Just like that. He’d started it years 
before. You see- 
(leaning forward) 
- he wasn’t ready to finish it then. 
He hadn’t been ready to own up to 
what the song needed to say. 
BLOGGER 
And did it say? What did the song say? 
OLDER BRIAN 
(smirks) 
Listen to it! 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY 
FREDDIE plays the song for the BAND on a WHITE GRAND 
PIANO... 
FREDDIE 
(singing) 
“Mama, life has just begun and now 
I’ve gone and thrown it all away. 
JOHN comes in softly with his BASS part... 
FREDDIE 
“Mama, oooooooh, Didn't mean to make 
you cry, 
If I'm not back again this time 
tomorrow, 
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing 
really matters. 
ROGER now comes in, softly, beautifully, on the drums...

Sent shivers down my spine, 
Body's aching all the time... 
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go -

OLDER BRIAN 
“Gotta leave you all behind and face 
the truth!” 
What truth? It’s obvious... 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO /ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
FREDDIE 
“Mama, oooooooh, I don't wanna die, 
I sometimes wish I'd never been 
born at all. 
FREDDIE plays a few more notes and then stops - 
BRIAN 
What happens then? 
FREDDIE stops, turns, looks at BRIAN. 
FREDDIE 
I think that’s where the Opera bit 
comes in. 
BRIAN looks at ROGER and JOHN. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
The Opera bit! Yes, the Opera Bit! 
BRIAN goes to the PIANO, throws open the lid and starts to 
play the chords of the OPERA BIT... 
OLDER BRIAN 
No rock song had so thoroughly changed 
its very nature midway through, as if-- 
as if the passion of the sentiment 
couldn’t be contained by the existing 
form and everything had to be 
exploded. It shouldn’t have worked, 
and yet--it was sublime.

Bit too fast, Fred. It’s okay, 
it’s just a wee bit too fast.

ROGER 
It’s not exactly “Killer Queen”. EMI’s

made. That’s official. 
RAY FOSTER 
And as for Bohemian - 
JOE BASTIN 
Rhapsody - 
RAY FOSTER 
What is that? It goes on forever - six 
minutes! Six minutes? 
FREDDIE 
I pity your wife if you think six 
minutes is forever. It’s a rhapsody. 
FINANCIAL OFFICER 
It’s a travesty. 
FREDDIE 
We want to release it as our single. 
RAY FOSTER 
Well, that’s not possible. Anything 
over 3 minutes the radio stations 
won’t program it. And what on earth is 
it about anyway? Scaramouche, Gallileo-

shrugs - 
FREDDIE 
(obfuscating) 
It’s nonsense. Doesn’t mean anything. 
This does little to appease FOSTER - and then - 
JOHN REID 
Actually, I agree. We do need the 
BBC and their format is 3 minutes 
tops. I have to agree with Roy. 
FREDDIE looks at JOHN REID, furious - gives his ‘Et Tu 
Brute’ look. ROGER and BRIAN and JOHN also stare at JOHN 
REID, outraged. 
JOHN REID 
I think the single is--”Love Of My 
Life.” It’s slow, but it’s strong. 
JOHN REID looks back at FREDDIE and holds up his hands -

My job is to turn things around for 
you. “Love of my Life”.

an operatic single? You can’t. 
FINANCIAL OFFICER 
My point exactly.

minute quasi-operatic dirge comprised 
of nonsense words! 
INT. PUB - DAY 
FREDDIE and ROGER and BRIAN and JOHN in private conference. 
FREDDIE 
Do you believe our own manager taking 
their side? 
ROGER 
Then let’s promote Bo-Rap ourselves. 
Go on TV, play it live. 
JOHN 
Without the multi-tracking it’ll sound 
crap. Gotta sound huge, or not at all. 
ROGER 
Okay. Alright, then let’s film it 
ourselves, mime it to the recorded 
track, and give the film to TV to 
play. 
BRIAN and JOHN and FREDDIE stare at ROGER, who nods and 
raises his pint - 
BRIAN 
Can we do that? 
JOHN 
Be expensive to film something. 
BRIAN 
How much?

You appeared live on TV, or not at 
all. 
BRUCE GOWERS, the DIRECTOR, to his ASSISTANT DIRECTOR - 
BRUCE GOWERS 
OK--let me see the Multi-Facet 
Lens, try to make it interesting, 
hold it up... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
It became the first music video of 
all time and paved the way to MTV. 
The CAMERA passes over - 
- items on a table, firstly the famous RECORD cover of 
MARLENE DIETRICH (lit from above, hands crossed over her 
collar-bone - the CONCEPT/INSPIRATION for this VIDEO) - and 
then settles on CAMERA LENSES. The CAMERA ASSISTANT picks 
up one SPECIAL F/X LENS, and holds it over his face, 
checking it, and we see his face fragmented into FIVE 
faces, just before he holds it over the CAMERA LENS. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
62.

BRUCE GOWERS 
Thanks. Take it away. 
(the MF LENS is 
removed) 
Okay, standing by--“Bohemian 
Rhapsody”...Cue smoke... 
The DRY ICE machine kicks in, clouding the back-light 
behind the BAND. 
BRUCE GOWERS 
Roll sound. 
CAMERAMAN 
Rolling. 
BRUCE GOWERS 
Mark it. 
The CAMERA ASSISTANT holds up the CLAPPER BOARD - on it is 
marked: 
VIDEO - BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, QUEEN, DIRECTOR BRUCE GOWERS” 
BRUCE GOWERS 
And--roll the track please. 
In 5,4,3,2,1 - Music. 
We hear: 
ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE 
(singing) 
“Is this the real life, 
BRUCE GOWERS 
Standby cross-fade - 
ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE 
- is this just fantasy, caught in a 
landslide, no escape from reality. 
BRUCE GOWERS 
Cross-fade, and up you come. 
The TOP LIGHT comes up as the BACK-LIGHT fades out. The 
FOUR FACES are revealed...bodies in black...FOUR Marlene 
Dietrichs (FRED’s hands crossed over his collar-bone) 
ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE 
Open your eyes look up to the skies... 
(The OPERA BIT continues - Reproduce a perfect facsimile of 
the FAMOUS VIDEO - same shots and camera-angles.) 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
63.

OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
The video was ground-breaking but no 
station was going to screen it unless 
the song was getting massive radio 
airplay... 
INT. CAPITAL RADIO / STUDIO 1 - DAY 
Outrageously ‘camp’ DJ, KENNY EVERETT, sings his signature 
tune, then resumes interviewing FREDDIE... 
KENNY 
In the studio today, singer Fffrederick 
Mercury! Freddie--welcome, 
you’ve just recorded your fourth 
album. Can you rr-reveal the title? 
FREDDIE 
A Night At The Opera. 
KENNY 
(posh voice) 
Oh how marvellous. 
(cockney voice) 
“We love the opera round ‘ere, dun’t 
we Ena?” 
(woman’s voice) 
“Yes we do dear.” 
FREDDIE 
One night we were all watching a Marx 
Brothers movie, it was called A Night 
At The Opera, and we all thought “Oh 
that’s rather good”, why don’t we just 
call it that? 
KENNY 
Queen--you’re a very shy bunch, 
really, aren’t you? 
FREDDIE 
Me shy? Yes I am actually. People 
don’t seem to realise. Just because 
I go tearing around on stage, they 
think I should go tearing round 
life--but I don’t really. 
CUT TO: 
OFF-AIR. FREDDIE slips KENNY EVERETT a copy of a SINGLE 
(45 RPM) RECORD - Kenny reads the title? 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
64.

KENNY 
“Bohemian Rrrrhapsody”? Jolly title. 
FREDDIE 
The BBC won’t play it, so EMI 
won’t release it. 
KENNY 
Rotten dogs. Why not? 
FREDDIE 
It’s 6 minutes long. 
KENNY looks out the STUDIO WINDOW to his PRODUCERS in next 
room, then scrunches up his face like a naughty school-boy, 
and HIDES the ‘45’ under his JACKET. 
KENNY 
Ooooooooooohhhh! 
CUT TO: 
KENNY EVERETT’s PRODUCERS, furious now, BEAT on the WINDOW, 
before trying to rattle open the door which is locked. 
KENNY 
And that was “Bohemian Rhapsody” 
for the--what was it?--the 13th time 
to-day? Gee wizz, we just lurve that 
little song here at Captial Radio. In 
fact, we love it so much, how ‘bout 
we pppplay it again! 
The PRODUCER, outside, shakes his head, issuing a FINAL 
WARNING, but KENNY raises his INDEX FINGER HIGH and then 
theatrically drops it on the PLAY BUTTON. “BO-RAP” starts 
again... 
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE the BOOTH... 
FREDDIE 
Tried to stop him from playing it. 
So many times! Tse! 
The PRODUCERS turn and see FREDDIE standing right behind 
them, talking to PAUL PRENTER, both looking in at KENNY. 
FREDDIE 
(to PRENTER) 
Just wouldn’t listen. Must be a 
nightmare to work with. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
65.

FREDDIE grins, covering buck-teeth with hand, then walks 
off down the long RADIO STATION HALLWAY with PRENTER (who 
share a low-key HI-FIVE), as the PRODUCERS watch... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
With this one album, we became one 
of the biggest bands in the world. 
And that one song? It was the most 
expensive song ever made, at the 
time--and it didn’t win a Grammy - 
that went to... 
CUT TO: 
VIDEO EXCERPT: “CHICAGO” (1976) playing “IF YOU LEAVE ME 
NOW”...a low-wattage song and performance... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...something more deserving. Hell, 
Hendrix, Bob Marley, The Who, and Led 
Zeppelin never won a Grammy either! 
But Bohemian Rhapsody did become the 
third biggest-selling song of all 
time--and is routinely voted the 
greatest song of all time...so... 
in your face Chicago! 
EXT. HYDE PARK CONCERT (1976) - SUNSET 
A VAST CROWD awaits QUEEN’s arrival on-stage, CLAPPING, in 
HIGH EXCITEMENT - 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Overnight, we were loved. We wanted 
to repay the fans--with a free 
concert...We played Hyde Park to 
150,000 people. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
BLOGGER 
What was that like? To walk out on 
stage in front of so many people? 
OLDER BRIAN 
What was it like? It was... 
CONTINUED: (2) 
66.

I/E. HYDE PARK STAGE - SUNSET 
The BAND make their way to the STAGE, and as they do so, 
the CLAMOR of the VAST AUDIENCE actually FADES to SILENCE, 
to total SILENCE... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...like nothing else. Energy like you 
couldn’t believe-- 
SOUNDLESSLY the band makes their way onto the stage, the 
CAMERA trailing them, until the CAMERA reveals what the 
band see as they step on-stage - 
- MASSED HUMANITY! But silent - 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
A tidal wave of sound, but more than 
that. Of approval. Approbation. 
Validation. A rush of joy. Love! 
Filling your soul and washing away 
your worries, fears, pain, making you 
into something you never dreamed you 
could be. 
EXT. STAGE/ HYDE PARK - DAY 
REACTION FREDDIE, ROGER, JOHN, and lastly BRIAN - Awestruck 
by a sound we can’t hear - CUT-AWAYS of members of 
the wildly gesturing (but SOUNDTRACK-MUTED) CROWD... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
When we went over our allotted time? 
The police shut us down but no-one 
would go home. 150,000 people stayed. 
We were suddenly the biggest band in 
the world. Well, we sold tickets 
faster than anyone. We toured like 
people possessed... 
EXT. SANTA MONICA CIVIC AUDITORIUM/ 1976 US TOUR - NIGHT 
BAND plays “TIE YOUR MOTHER DOWN” 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
America. 32 dates coast to coast. 
67.

EXT. JAPAN TOUR/ 1976 - NIGHT 
FREDDIE engages the crowd with his “DAY-O” ROUTINE.... 
FREDDIE 
Dayyyy---OOOOO!
JAPANESE CROWD 
Dayyyy---OOOOO!
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Japan. Australia. UK. 
EXT. ARGENTINA TOUR/ BUENOS AIRES/ 1981 - DAY 
Police motorcycles lead a TANK down the CROWD-LINED street 
of BUENOS AIRES, with the motorcycles crisscrossing to keep 
civilians and cars away from the tank. 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Then came South America. No one 
had ever played that part of the 
globe-- but Freddie... 
Appearing out the TOP of the TANK, FREDDIE MERCURY, waving 
a ARGENTINIAN FLAG... 
FREDDIE 
(to his band-mates 
below) 
Isn’t this fun, darlings?! 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...Freddie realised that after the 
World Cup there might be some nice 
little stadiums not being used by 
anyone. 
EXT. STAGE/ SAO PAOLO/ 1981 - NIGHT 
FREDDIE walks out on-stage to a FOOTBALL STADIUM AUDIENCE 
of 58,000 (nearly all of whom waving LIT LIGHTERS!) He 
waves to this TWINKLING GALAXY of PEOPLE... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
There were. 
CUT TO: 
(CONTINUED) 
68.

Onstage, FREDDIE has his eyes closed, as if PRAYING, as - 
58,000 Brazilians sing “LOVE OF MY LIFE”! A tremendously 
moving - almost holy - experience for him. 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
58,000 people. Most couldn’t 
speak English but they could 
sing Freddie’s song. 
When FREDDIE opens his eyes - he has TEARS in them. 
CUT TO: 
BRIAN, on-stage alone, starts an extended GUITAR SOLO, as 
FREDDIE jogs from the stage... 
CUT TO: 
...Backstage - FREDDIE quickly changes into a new costume, 
with the help of PAUL PRENTER, as BRIAN’s SOLO continues. 
ROGER drains a cup of water... 
FREDDIE 
How long has Brian been going? 
ROGER 
Ahh--’bout five minutes so far. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN, eyes closed, remembering, smiling, plays the 
RED SPECIAL GUITAR (unplugged) - as we hear him reproduce 
the virtuosic lead-break (mutely) on the un-amplified 
strings... 
EXT. STAGE/ SAO PAOLO/ 1981 - DAY 
...BRIAN, on-stage, alone, at full volume again, still 
cutting loose on the RED SPECIAL - 
CUT TO: 
FREDDIE, now slouched in a chair, in his new costume and 
waiting to go back on, but awaiting the end of BRIAN’s 
SOLO. PAUL PRENTER checks his watch - 
FREDDIE 
(to PRENTER) 
Fuck it, let’s go shopping. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
69.

PAUL PRENTER 
This is ridiculous. 
Just then the STAGE MANAGER enters - 
STAGE-MANAGER 
Freddie, Roger - it’s ending. 
FREDDIE and ROGER stalk back on-stage, to a roar from the 
CROWD. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
And the parties?! 
(pause) 
Well--I was a married man... 
INT. FANCY DRESS PARTY/ BALLROOM (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT 
A BACCHANALIAN REVEL straight from the imagination of 
FELLINI - we see the FUN of being one of the biggest bands 
in the world... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
But there were temptations... 
MONTAGE A (NEW ORLEANS PARTY): of - 
A) BRIAN on the BALCONY, surveys, from above the hotel 
ballroom, made up to resemble labyrinthine jungle swamps, 
swarming with - 
B) Naked dancers, cavorting in bamboo cages suspended from 
ballroom ceilings. 
C) Magicians 
D) Zulu tribesmen 
E) Contortionists 
F) Fire-eaters 
G) FREDDIE, dressed in an outrageous costume, greets 
(loving) GUESTS and hands out GIFTS as they arrive. Helping 
him to hand out gifts is PAUL PRENTER... 
PAUL PRENTER 
From Freddie, just a little something. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
70.

The GUESTS OOOHHH and AHHHH as they open their GIFTS - 
WRIST-WATCHES for the MEN, JEWELRY for the WOMEN. 
H) JOHN and his WIFE are served champagne by naked waiters 
and waitresses who carry their tips in their bodily 
crevices. 
I) Nude models of both sexes wrestle in huge baths of 
shimmering, uncooked liver. 
J) QUEEN’s “BICYCLE RACE” VIDEO (with nude girls on bikes) 
is projected on to a screen. 
K) FREDDIE signs his AUTOGRAPH on the BUTT of a GLAM FEMALE 
FAN, who has hoisted up her BALL-GOWN and pulled low her 
KNICKERS. PAUL PRENTER roars with laughter. 
L) HERMAPHRODITE DWARVES deliver COKE on TRAYS strapped to 
their heads...PAUL PRENTER directs one of the DWARVES in 
the direction of - FREDDIE. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
BLOGGER 
I heard the “Dwarves with trays of 
coke on their heads” didn’t actually 
happen? So it’s true! 
OLDER BRIAN 
It’s hard to know what to believe 
sometimes, even when you were there. 
The BLOGGER is confused - so did it happen, or not? 
MONTAGE B (NEW ORLEANS PARTY): of - 
M) A dwarf lies on a table beneath cold cuts of meat - he 
jiggles when a slice is removed. This causes a FEMALE DINER 
to scream with SURPRISE. 
N) ROGER entertains 3 ATTRACTIVE WOMEN. 
O) BRIAN watches the entire scene from the BALCONY, while 
being interviewed by a JAPANESE BLOGGER... 
BRIAN 
It’s so nice to have a quiet 
night for a change. 
He then looks down upon the world the band created. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
71.

P) FREDDIE, climbs onto a BALCONY and prepares to DIVE on 
to a CHANDELIER. 
The CROWD shouts to FREDDIE, trying to stop him, but 
FREDDIE isn’t listening. He dives toward a CHANDELIER. He 
makes it! But the CHANDELIER collapses under his weight, 
and the whole thing - and FREDDIE - drops onto a CAKETABLE, 
softening his fall. CRASH! 
The CAMERA descends on the supine FREDDIE, over - 
OLD BRIAN (V.O.) 
Everything changed--so why wouldn’t 
we? How could we not? It was a dream 
come true. The world seemed to be 
unanimously saying to each of us - 
“Genius!” How could we resist such a 
verdict? We were kids! 
FREDDIE, lying there, winces in pain - as JOHN DEACON comes 
to his rescue, helping him up... 
FREDDIE 
Couldn’t resist--always wanted to 
swing on a chandelier. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLD BRIAN 
But--the pressure! The expectation, 
night after night, that comes with 
such fame? That, we were not prepared 
for. 
EXT. STAGE/ HYDE PARK CONCERT - NIGHT 
The BAND at full tilt, playing the climactic CHORD/NOTE of 
a big song - FREDDIE dancing, SWEAT POURING OFF HIM, the 
BAND playing at double speed, sustaining the tension of the 
last chord, bathed in SWEAT also, faster, faster, faster - 
the vast audience climactic too... 
(INTERCUT with - ) 
MONTAGE (GLOBAL AUDIENCES) 
A) US AUDIENCE ecstatic (QUEEN in a different costume) 
B) JAPANESE AUDIENCE ecstatic (QUEEN in a different 
costume) 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
72.

C) BRAZILIAN AUDIENCE ecstatic (QUEEN in a different 
costume) 
D) LONDON (HYDE PARK) AUDIENCE ecstatic (QUEEN back in the 
original Hyde Park costume) 
INT. DRESSING ROOM/ BACKSTAGE/ HYDE PARK CONCERT - NIGHT 
Silence. FREDDIE and BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN collapse sideby 
side on TWO COUCHES after the concert. ALL are bathed in 
sweat, utterly drained of energy. JOHN REID nods at JIM 
BEACH, the band’s lawyer, who - 
- herds everyone else, including himself, out of the room - 
except for one - PAUL PRENTER. 
JOHN REID 
Very important gig for us. 
ROGER 
Almost as important as tomorrow 
night’s, and the night after that - 
JOHN 
- and the night after week after month 
after that. 
JOHN REID 
Excuse me--where does it say it would 
be easy? 
(beat) 
Your four cars are waiting outside for 
you. 
BRIAN 
Why four cars? 
JOHN REID 
From now on, you each have separate 
cars and drivers. 
FREDDIE 
My voice is cracking up. I’m a 
baritone pretending to be a soprano. 
I need to rest my voice. 
JOHN REID 
What you need is to stop burning the 
candles at both ends. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
73.

FREDDIE 
But the glow from both ends is so 
divine. 
JOHN REID 
Get showered everyone. Get something 
to eat. Back to the hotel. Sleep. See 
you on plane at 6 am. Don’t get high, 
don’t get drunk, you have a photoshoot 
at 9 in Berlin, interviews all 
day, arena sound-check at 5, show at 
8. Your next day off? 
(looks at his watch) 
November. 
JOHN REID exits, as PAUL PRENTER clocks the tension. 
ROGER 
I’m beginning to hate him. 
FREDDIE covers his face with his hands - he’s really bone 
tired, exhausted...then emerges, melancholic... 
PAUL PRENTER 
(to FREDDIE) 
I’ll run your bath. 
PRENTER exits. 
FREDDIE’s POV of: his friends... 
FREDDIE 
If I ever get lost, come and find me, 
would you? 
ROGER 
What are you on about? 
FREDDIE 
Really lost. 
BRIAN 
Course. 
FREDDIE 
(intensely) 
Promise me. 
BRIAN 
Sure Fred. You got it. 
ROGER 
Yeah. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
74.

JOHN 
No problem. 
FREDDIE pulls off his top and grabs a towel, going to take 
a shower... 
FREDDIE 
My throat, it’s like a vulture’s 
crotch. 
ROGER and JOHN and BRIAN share a concerned look. 
INT. LIMO - NIGHT 
FREDDIE and JOHN REID ride in the backseat - 
JOHN REID 
Listen to me now. You’ve seen what 
I’ve done for Elton. 4% of all records 
purchased last year? In the world? 
Elton John. Who is his band? Do we 
care? I’m just saying, if you went-- 
solo--Freddie Mercury--I guarantee you 
could do even better. Guarantee it. 
FREDDIE 
You’re seriously asking me--to break 
up the band? 
JOHN REID 
I’m telling you what awaits you if 
you go solo. 
FREDDIE 
You’ve seen what happens when we work 
together? 
JOHN REID 
I’ve seen what you do for them. 
FREDDIE stares at JOHN REID, until - 
FREDDIE 
OK. I’ll go solo. 
JOHN REID 
Yeah? 
FREDDIE 
Yeah. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
75.

JOHN REID 
Yes! Alright! I am so relieved. 
JOHN offers his hand and FREDDIE shakes it - emotional, 
knowing what is coming next... 
JOHN REID 
Coz I have been having such huge 
problems with that band...I don’t know 
how you’ve put up with it. 
FREDDIE 
(to the driver) 
Pull over. Pull over. 
The LIMO stops. FREDDIE leans over and opens REID’s door - 
FREDDIE 
Get out. Out. Get out, it’s over. 
You’re fired John. You’re gone. 
JOHN REID 
What are you talking about “fired”? 
FREDDIE 
Get out of the car. Get out of the 
car! GET OUT! 
JOHN REID 
Freddie! 
FREDDIE pushes JOHN REID out and then uses his FEET - 
FREDDIE 
OUT! OUT! 
EXT. LIMO - NIGHT 
REID is kicked out of the LIMO by FREDDIE, who then slams 
the door, before the LIMO pulls away. 
JOHN REID 
FREDDIE! 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
FREDDIE and MARY and BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN and PAUL 
PRENTER and JOE BASTIN and JIM BEACH are having DINNER in a 
fine-dining restaurant. WAITERS hover around their star 
guest, as FREDDIE speaks - 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
76.

FREDDIE 
We’ll manage ourselves from now on. 
Mr Beach here, you’ll take care of 
the rest, won’t you dear? 
JIM BEACH 
Me? 
FREDDIE 
“Miami” New name for you. You ever 
looked after a band before, Miami? 
Points deducted for hesitation. 
JIM BEACH 
No. 
FREDDIE 
All in favour of Miami here looking 
after us from now on? 
JOHN and ROGER and BRIAN all nod. 
FREDDIE 
This is fun. Who else can we hire or 
fire? 
FREDDIE looks at JOE BASTIN - 
JOE BASTIN 
What? 
FREDDIE 
Bohemian Rhapsody was “too long”, it 
would “never work as a single”. 
JOE BASTIN 
My sincerest apologies. 
FREDDIE 
Funny--apologies take so long, 
but criticism arrives just like that! 
JOE BASTIN 
But! I still think “Love Of My Life” 
would have been the better choice! 
Over laughter, FREDDIE picks up a bottle, as if to strike 
JOE - 
JOE BASTIN 
Just kidding! Just kidding! 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
77.

Under the table JOE pats FREDDIE’s LEG as he grins at the 
others - 
JOE BASTIN 
We’re all here for you, Freddie. 
FREDDIE reacts to the tap on the knee and the look in JOE 
BASTIN’s eyes like an ELECTRIC SHOCK. Did BASTIN just make 
a pass at him? 
MARY observes this - and feels left out. 
PAUL PRENTER 
Tell us about your childhood? 
FREDDIE 
(shakes his head) 
Uh uh uh uh. The future? (pointing) 
It’s that way! Fuck today, it’s 
tomorrow already. 
JIM BEACH 
Such an enigma.
FREDDIE 
Oh I hope so. True stardom is the 
absence of detail. 
But the clues are all in my songs. 
They’re all... 
FREDDIE eyes go back to JOE BASTIN, who is talking now with 
PAUL PRENTER... 
FREDDIE 
...in my... 
As FREDDIE watches BASTIN - MARY notices. When FREDDIE, 
embarrassed, turns back to looks at her, he kisses her on 
the cheek and TAPS her on the leg in the exact same way 
BASTIN just did to him. 
Noticing all this, is ROGER, who looks between FREDDIE, 
MARY and JOE BASTIN, even while chatting up a BRUNETTE 
BEAUTY. 
INT. PARTY - NIGHT 
FREDDIE and JOE BASTIN are talking. FREDDIE seems nervous, 
shy. JOE BASTIN then kisses FREDDIE on the CHEEK. JOE 
BASTIN then walks off, into the crowd, as - FREDDIE is 
joined by MARY and PAUL PRENTER, who carries drinks. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
78.

PAUL PRENTER 
Here we go. And - Freddie?--just want 
to thank you. 
But FREDDIE’s mind is only on JOE BASTIN - 
PAUL PRENTER 
For keeping me on, you know?--I will 
live and die for you, man. Want you to 
know that. Freddie? 
FREDDIE 
Be back in a second. Paul, look 
after Mary, would you? 
FREDDIE pushes through the crowd, going after BASTIN, and 
is gone. 
MARY and PRENTER, who don’t like each other, are stranded 
there, with their preposterous drinks. 
REACTION, MARY: Anxious. Knows something is going on. She 
sips her drink and then looks at PAUL...He smiles weakly at 
her, INSINCERELY... 
PAUL PRENTER 
Pretty dress. 
(beat) 
Make it yourself? 
MARY, insulted, stares at PAUL, her dislike confirmed. 
INT. FREDDIE & MARY’S FLAT/ LONDON - DAY 
MARY comes in with SHOPPING BAGS and a stack of BRIDAL 
CATALOGUES. FREDDIE is sleeping off his hang-over. MARY is 
still carrying anxiety, but trying to hide it. 
MARY 
Oh, not still in bed?! Come on. If 
you come in so late that’s your fault. 
Get up! 
She tugs at his COVERS. 
MARY 
Come on! I want your opinion on 
wedding dresses and venues--we have a 
choice of three. Freddie?! Freddie! 
We need to talk about the wedding! 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
79.

FREDDIE 
Whose wedding? 
ANNOYED, she tugs off the COVERS completely - exposing him, 
TOTALLY NUDE. He makes no move, comfortable with nudity. 
MARY 
That’s it! Up! Now! 
MARY then opens a SHOPPING BAG and takes out a BRIDAL HAT 
with VEIL... 
FREDDIE 
Mary! You’re fired. I need to sleep! 
Anyway--I have to save my voice. 
It’s insured for a million dollars. 
MARY 
And it’s still annoying. Now get up 
and tell me what you think... 
(puts on hat & veil) 
...of this. Well? 
FREDDIE looks at her, then lowers his head, guilty. 
MARY 
Say something. 
FREDDIE gets up, wraps himself in a men’s silk JAPANESE 
KIMONO. 
MARY 
You don’t like it? Freddie? 
He walks toward her - looks at her face through the VEIL 
and then slowly raises the VEIL. His SAD face alerts her to 
his PROBLEMS. She slowly takes off her HAT & VEIL... 
MARY 
What is it? What’s going on? 
He holds her hands tenderly, looks at the ENGAGEMENT RING 
on her finger, and then stares into her eyes... 
FREDDIE 
You know me better than anyone. 
I want you at my side for the rest 
of my life. You know that. 
MARY 
Yeah. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
80.

FREDDIE 
You know that. But - 
The truth hits MARY in this moment - 
MARY 
(anticipating) 
Say it. “But” what? 
FREDDIE 
Mary - 
TEARS come to her eyes. 
MARY 
Say it. Say it. Go on. It’s okay. 
Freddie. It’s okay. Go on. 
FREDDIE 
(emotion breaking 
through) 
I’m. Bi-sexual. 
MARY 
No. I love you--but you’re 
fucking gay. 
EMOTION breaks over them both like an ocean - 
FREDDIE 
It’s the Kimono? 
ANGRY (at herself mainly) - but feeling CHEATED, REJECTED 
again - her life once more a lonely mess!... 
MARY 
I’m such an idiot! So stupid! 
FREDDIE 
Mary--come on. 
MARY 
I deserve this, I deserve it! 
FREDDIE 
You don’t deserve this! 
MARY 
Oh but I do! It’s what I’ve always 
settled for...”I love you, but -”, “I 
love you, but I’ve met someone else”, 
“I love you, but I need some space”...

“I love you...but I’m gay!”--that tops 
them all, that’s the toughest, because 
it’s not your fault, not at all...it’s 
mine, all mine, and that’s why I 
deserve to be alone. 
FREDDIE 
We’re all fucking alone. Everyone’s 
alone! 
MARY 
I wanted children with you. 
(tears arriving) 
I could see our children--I could 
see our children Freddie! 
Your brown skin...little buck teeth... 
The WRINKLE of a smile from her but this is instantly lost 
again under her LOSS and PAIN - 
MARY 
I totally understand why people 
kill themselves. It’s too much. 
Oh I can’t breath. I have to breath. 
Isn’t that ironic? I have to breath 
even when I don’t want to? 
FREDDIE 
Baby, darling--we have each other, in 
the most important way. We love each 
other. Without end. To the end. Okay? 
It’s gonna be okay. We’ll find a way. 
MARY 
Was going to be “Richard”, if it was a 
boy. “Janey” if a girl. 
FREDDIE 
You want kids? We’ll buy some. I think 
you can get ‘em from Harrods--they 
sell everything. If you buy two they 
throw in a nanny. 
He has TEARS coming from his eyes now too - She touches his 
face tenderly...lovingly... 
MARY 
Your life’s going to be hard, 
my darling. 
FREDDIE 
I know.

MARY (CONT'D)

MARY 
I’ll move out. 
MARY starts to take off her ENGAGEMENT RING - 
FREDDIE 
Stop. No. Don’t take it off. I 
don’t want you to ever take it off. 
MARY 
What do you want from me, Freddie? 
FREDDIE 
Everything? 
(beat) 
Almost. 
They embrace. It’s clear - they are inextricably bound, for 
better or worse. 
INT. FREDDIE’S MANSION - DAY 
FREDDIE is moving in to his ENORMOUS mansion. The rooms are 
largely empty, except for CATS - more than we have seen 
before. FREDDIE instructs the PIANO MOVERS where to put the 
STEINWAY. 
FREDDIE 
Just there. Careful. That’s good. 
ROGER enters, looks around. 
ROGER 
Is it big enough? 
FREDDIE 
Just! Each cat has its own room-- 
it’s perfect. Delilah’s by the 
kitchen, Goliath next door, upstairs 
Romeo, Oscar, Tiffany, Miko...Lily’s 
room is huge, spoilt thing. 
ROGER 
(pacing) 
Still not sure the echo is 
quite pronounced enough. 
FREDDIE 
Mary found it for me. Isn’t it 
wonderful?! So I’m poor again. I don’t 
mind. Money is for spending. I’m 
determined to be happy here! 
CONTINUED: (4) 
(CONTINUED) 
83.

ROGER nods - sees that unhappiness is a ghost that haunts 
his friend. 
FREDDIE 
Stay. For dinner. 
ROGER 
I can’t. Kids. Wife. See you. 
ROGER hugs FREDDIE and looks into FRED’s eyes - a brotherly 
moment that says “You’re gonna be fine.” ROGER exits. 
FREDDIE, after a moment’s sadness, turns his attention back 
to the placement of the PIANO... 
FREDDIE 
(to the PIANO MOVERS) 
Not there... 
INT. FREDDIE’S MANSION - NIGHT 
FREDDIE pours one glass of MOET, then paces slowly between 
the empty rooms. Looking at his costly new things - most of 
them unwrapped - TIFFANY LAMPS, LOUIS XIV CHAIRS. He plays 
ARETHA FRANKLIN’s “Sweet Bitter Love” on a record player. 
He listens intently, unbearably lonely, then picks up the 
TELEPHONE and goes to the WINDOW. 
FREDDIE 
(into phone) 
Mary? Turn off your living room 
light, then turn it on again. 
Flash them on and off. Go on. 
I’ll do the same. 
FREDDIE’s POV of a DISTANT APARTMENT’s LIGHTS (MARY’s) 
going on and off. FREDDIE SMILES as he turns off his own 
LIVING ROOM lights and turns them on again. 
FREDDIE 
Isn’t it perfect we still live 
so close to each other? 
INT. MARY’S NEW FLAT - NIGHT 
MARY 
(mournful, into phone) 
I’m never going to get away, am I? 
CONTINUED: 
84.

INT. FREDDIE’S MANSION - NIGHT 
A CAT sits on the lid of the STEINWAY as FREDDIE composes - 
what will become "Somebody To Love." He plays the first 
piano part...the INTRO... starting slowly, softly, 
developing it until he finds what he wants. He picks up his 
pen and notates the music...As he WRITES we hear (on the 
SOUNDTRACK) the music he is hearing in his head. The piano 
intro is repeated... 
MONTAGE (The Search For Love) 
A) RESTAURANT. FREDDIE and JOE BASTIN talk over DINNER... 
FREDDIE (V.O.) 
“Each morning I get up I die a little 
Can barely stand on my feet 
Take a look in the mirror and cry 
Lord what you're doing to me 
B) MARY’s FLAT. MARY frames a PHOTOGRAPH of herself and 
FREDDIE...alone, with FREDDIE’s cats. 
FREDDIE (V.O.) 
“I have spent all my years in 
believing you 
But I just can't get no relief, 
Lord!... 
Somebody - 
B) MANOR RECORDING STUDIO. ROGER, BRIAN and FREDDIE share a 
MIC and record the GOSPEL BACKING TRACK - a monumental 
gospel feel - 
ROGER/BRIAN/FREDDIE 
“SOMEBODY!!” 
C) FREDDIE’s MANSION - FREDDIE at his PIANO, sings - 
FREDDIE 
“Somebody...” 
D) MANOR RECORDING STUDIO - 
ROGER/BRIAN/FREDDIE 
“SOMEBODY!!..“CAN ANYBODY FIND ME...” 
E) FREDDIE’s MANSION - FREDDIE at his PIANO, sings -

F) ON A LAKE. FREDDIE and JOE BASTIN laugh as they try to 
SAIL a YACHT on a lake, and have no CLUE at first - but 
then they are soon underway, JOE at the TILLER, gliding 
along in a firm breeze. FREDDIE looks happy... 
G) RESTAURANT. MARY now has a date with a BACHELOR, until 
she is called away by the waiter, who indicates there is a 
PHONE-CALL for her... 
H) MARY picks up the PHONE... (INTERCUT with - ) 
I) ...FREDDIE, in tears on his couch with his CATS, talking 
on the phone to MARY, whilst watching his favorite DOUGLAS 
SIRK MOVIE - “Imitation Of Life” - specifically the 
climactic FUNERAL SCENE with LANA TURNER and the GOSPEL 
CHOIR. 
J) The BACHELOR, alone, looks at his WATCH, wondering when 
MARY will return... 
K) FREDDIE and MARY and JOE at a CLOTHING STORE CHECK-OUT 
all pile their clothes on the counter - 
CHECKOUT GIRL 
(looking at MARY and 
JOE) 
Paying for everyone? 
FREDDIE takes out his CREDIT-CARD. 
FREDDIE 
Everyone in the store darling! 
(to the SHOPPERS) 
Attention! For the next five minutes 
everything in the store is on me! 
Stunned looks from the SHOPPERS... 
L) Outside the CLOTHING STORE, all the HAPPY SHOPPERS, arms 
loaded with SHOPPING BAGS, applaud FREDDIE for his 
generosity as he and MARY and JOE emerge, and walk off down 
the street, waving them goodbye. 
FREDDIE (V.O.) 
“I work hard...Every day of my life... 
I work till I ache in my bones! 
At the end of the day I take home my 
hard earned pay, all on my own. I get 
down on my knees...and I...pray...

L) NEW YORK HOTEL. FREDDIE sits on the end of the BED, as 
JOE BASTIN ZIPS up his bag, making to go. 
FREDDIE 
Everybody goes...Who is it? Who are 
you seeing? 
JOE BASTIN 
I can live with a rock-star, but not 
one that’s not ready to commit. Your 
work comes first. Right? 
FREDDIE 
(sadly) 
Handsome Joe. 
Kind Joe. 
JOE looks at FREDDIE fondly, then exits the HOTEL ROOM. 
FREDDIE is tearful, but sniffs it away, straightens his 
spine. He stands...and goes into the BATHROOM... 
M) ...FREDDIE soaks in the hotel bath, forlorn, writing 
LYRICS on the wall with a MAGIC MARKER: 
“This thing called love, I just can’t handle it, I ain’t 
ready” 
FREDDIE (V.O.) 
“Somebody tooooooooooooooooo.... 
...luuuuuuuuuuuuuuve.” 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
“Grotesquery of the first order.” 
That’s what the Music Press called our 
next album, A Day At The Races! 
Grotesquery! That hurt Freddie... 
He took criticism to heart. Every 
insult, every bad review sent him 
back to where he’d come from--to 
being that little immigrant boy. 
(checking his watch)

Anyway, are we done? You said this 
would be quick.
BLOGGER 
Couple more questions, almost there. 
What was the criticism like? 
INT. PRESS CONFERENCE/ NEW YORK - DAY 
QUEEN on stage before a packed room of JOURNALISTS and 
critics. 
FREDDIE, puffing on a cigarette, is in the mood for a 
fight! 
ANGLE ON: BRIAN, concerned for FREDDIE - 
FREDDIE 
We know you all hate us, but it’s what 
the public thinks that matters to us. 
CRITIC 1 
(female) 
I don’t hate you Freddie. I just 
wonder why you’re so successful? 
FREDDIE 
And I wonder how big your cunt is--can 
you fit it over your head like a hat? 
The BAND winces. So does JIM BEACH and PRENTER at the back 
of the room. The CRITICS can’t believe their ears - 
FREDDIE 
Sorry, just don’t like bullies. 
CRITIC 3 
Freddie--your private life - 
FREDDIE 
Next question? 
CRITIC 2 
Freddie--why don’t you get your teeth 
fixed? 
FREDDIE 
I live in Britain--I don’t want to 
stand out. 
(laughter)

OLDER BRIAN (CONT'D)

Besides, I need them--I lie through 
them. 
(laughter)
CRITIC 3 
Is it true there are tensions in the 
band. 
FREDDIE 
No. None. None at all. Never have 
been. 
ROGER 
Let’s just say we are four very 
strong personalities. 
FREDDIE 
We’re four cocks--fighting--roosters 
that is. 
(looks at his annoyed 
bandmates) 
The band don’t like my answers--And 
frankly I don’t much care for theirs. 
ROGER and BRIAN and JOHN look at FREDDIE, annoyed, but what 
can you do? 
CRITIC 4 
“Bismillah”. What does it mean? 
FREDDIE 
Nothing - 
But FREDDIE then leans over to BRIAN and WHISPERS something 
into his ear. BRIAN reacts in a way that suggests that 
FREDDIE just told him what “Bismillah” means. 
INT. BACKSTAGE/ US TOUR 3 - NIGHT 
The BAND, just off the stage, sit for one of FREDDIE’s post 
concert banquets. 
JOHN 
“We Are The Champions”? It sounds 
so conceited. 
FREDDIE 
It’s not about us. 
(indicating the table) 
Sit. Everybody sit. Just because 
we’re on tour doesn’t mean we have 
to live like animals. Sit. I want

us all to start dining together 
after every show. 
JOHN and ROGER and BRIAN sit at the grandly set TABLE. 
BRIAN 
“We Are The Champions”? The critics 
would - 
FREDDIE 
- Fuck the critics! It’s a song for 
the crowd - 
(pointing) 
- anyone who wants to taste victory, 
who’s never been allowed to. 
ROGER 
Then call it “You Are The Champions”. 
FREDDIE 
Sinatra could sing “I'm A-number-one, 
top of the list, king of the hill.” 
BRIAN 
Then it is about us? 
FREDDIE 
(lifting lids) 
Beluga caviar. Rare beef. Champagne. 
Moet naturally. Eat! 
ROGER 
Like the champions we are. 
FREDDIE 
You haven’t even heard the song yet. 
Everybody shuttup’n eat! 
They all slowly start to eat as PRENTER pours champagne. 
BRIAN 
So how’s it go? 
FREDDIE 
Like all our best work it’s just a 
little disposable thing, like a 
plastic razor...like a used tampon. 
BRIAN 
When we do the Rolling Stone 
interview, maybe find another 
metaphor.

EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT 
In concert, under a spot-light, FREDDIE sings his (public 
but encoded) declaration of who he is... In the 
presentation it should have a dramatic quality of a 
defendant in the witness stand, giving his testimony. 
FREDDIE 
(emotional) 
“I’ve paid my dues, 
Time after time. 
I've done my sentence 
But committed no crime. 
And bad mistakes? 
I've made a few. 
I've had my share of sand kicked in my 
face but I've come through. 
ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN 
“And I need just go on and on, and on, 
and on. 
FREDDIE/ROGER/BRIAN/JOHN 
“We are the champions, my friends, 
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the 
end. We are the champions. 
We are the champions. No time for 
losers 'cause we are the champions of 
the world. 
(to the crowd) 
Sing it! Let’s hear you! 
And then the CROWD take over, with FREDDIE conducting - 
CAMERA picks out INDIVIDUALS - all possible OUTCASTS 
uplifted by this song - a DIVERSE range of people from all 
walks of life who for a moment are raised up. 
CROWD 
“WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, MY FRIENDS, 
AND WE'LL KEEP ON FIGHTING 'TIL THE 
END. WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS... 
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS... 
NO TIME FOR LOSERS 'CAUSE WE ARE THE 
CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD!” 
FREDDIE spins, grinning, and looks at BRIAN, who is struck 
by the dialogue between band and audience that just 
happened. BRIAN’s expression says he has an idea. 
FREDDIE 
(grinning) 
Told you so! It’s their song! 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
91.

(turning back to the 
crowd) 
“I've taken my bows 
And my curtain calls 
You brought me fame and fortune and 
everything that goes with it 
I thank you all! 
The CROWD roars their love - 
FREDDIE turns and faces BRIAN and delivers the next lines 
straight to him - 
FREDDIE 
“But it's been no bed of roses, 
No pleasure cruise. 
I consider it a challenge before the 
whole human race 
And I ain't gonna lose!!!! 
BRIAN smiles at his MAGNIFICENT FRIEND. 
In the WINGS, angle on: 
MARY lovingly watching FREDDIE perform. Her eyes are on 
FREDDIE (on-stage), but she is holding the HAND of DAVID, 
her new boyfriend. 
DAVID notices how lovingly MARY looks at FREDDIE, and 
swallows his jealousy. 
INT. BACKSTAGE/ US TOUR 3 - NIGHT 
FREDDIE and BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN all excitedly discuss 
what just happened, as they undress. 
(The DRESSING ROOM is now, unlike before, FULL of people we 
have never seen before, HANGERS-ON. JIM BEACH is there, and 
so is PAUL PRENTER.) 
BRIAN 
That was amazing. They kept singing, 
even after we’d left the stage. 
FREDDIE 
They want to join the band, darling! 
Every fan sub-consciously wants to 
join the band. 
CONTINUED: 
FREDDIE (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUED) 
92.

BRIAN 
Then let’s let ‘em join the band. They 
can sing, they can clap, they can 
stamp their feet. Let’s write 
something that gets ‘em even more 
involved. 
FREDDIE 
The critics will hate it. Right 
then--first one to write a cracking 
audience participation song gets - 
(holds up a cookie) 
- a piece of my Mr Kiplings Almond 
Slice. I’m now having them flown in 
from London to go with my cup of tea. 
ROGER 
(to FREDDIE) 
Hey. Great song man. 
FREDDIE 
Why thankyou Roger. 
JOHN 
It’s a hit. 
FREDDIE 
Of course it’s a hit. But--muchos 
gracias amigos. 
MARY enters with her MAN, DAVID. 
MARY 
Freddie? 
FREDDIE turns - and looks at DAVID. FREDDIE tries to 
remember the guy’s name. 
MARY 
David. 
FREDDIE 
David! David. Hello dear. Be very 
good to Mary, won’t you. Sorry about 
this but we’re all about to change-- 
clothes. 
(to MARY) 
See you later. 
FREDDIE kisses MARY, and holds her TIGHT, for a LONG TIME, 
to the point where it’s embarrassing for MARY and 
concerning for DAVID.

FREDDIE 
Right. Lovely to meet you John. 
DAVID 
David. 
FREDDIE 
David! David. 
MARY scowls at FREDDIE, then leads DAVID away. 
FREDDIE sighs, then looks at his BAND - his BROTHERS, just 
then towelling off. 
FREDDIE 
Gentlemen? I have an announcement. 
Let’s get this out of the way. 
I’ll say this once and then I don’t 
want to discuss it again. 
(beat) 
I’m bisexual. 
Silence, then - 
ROGER 
You’re also very mean with your 
Almond Slices. 
FREDDIE GRINS, then covers his teeth coyly with his hand. 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO (BASING STREET) - DAY 
ENGINEER (MIKE STONE) 
Everyone! As many people as you can 
get! Up on the drum risers! Tea 
Ladies! Cleaners! Everyone! 
ANGLE ON: THE CROWD in the SOUND STAGE, all clambering up 
on the DRUM-RISERS. 
ENGINEER 
Okay. On Four. One, two, three, 
four... 
And all the BAND and the EXTRAS all start to do the famous 
“BOOM-BOOM-CHA”, as the TAPES RECORD IT.

EXT. UK CONCERT/ LONDON - NIGHT 
The IMMENSE CROWD all STAMP and CLAP in time to “WE WILL 
ROCK YOU”, until the BAND add to it, but they do not 
replace it - they integrate it. 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY 
FREDDIE starts to RECORD the VOCAL, but he is ONE OCTAVE 
HIGHER than the version we all know - in high FALSETTO. 
FREDDIE 
“Buddy you're a boy make a big noise, 
Playin' in the street gonna be a big 
man some day - 
BRIAN in the RECORDING BOOTH, hits the TANNOY button - 
BRIAN 
Freddie, Freddie, Jesus man! This 
isn’t Opera now--we want the audience 
to sing along to this one and you’re 
the only guy in the world who can 
sing that high. 
FREDDIE 
Drop it down? Y’think? 
They start again. FREDDIE drops it all down ONE OCTAVE - 
FREDDIE 
“Buddy you're a boy make a big noise, 
Playin' in the street gonna be a big 
man some day - 
FREDDIE looks at BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN who are all 
giving him now the THUMBS-UP, nodding. 
INT. NEW YORK BARBERSHOP - DAY 
HAIR falls onto the BARBERSHOP FLOOR. In the mirror we see 
the NEW FREDDIE, short-haired, clean-shaven, and now 
sporting a MUSTACHE! FREDDIE spins in the BARBERSHOP CHAIR 
and looks at - PAUL PRENTER, who nods his APPROVAL. FREDDIE 
GRINS, and then COVERS HIS TEETH with his hand coyly. 
EXT. NY GAY LEATHER CLUB (MINESHAFT) - DAY 
Outside the NOTORIOUS CLUB - FREDDIE and PAUL PRENTER look 
like GAY CLONE TWINS - mustache, short hair, leathers.

PAUL PRENTER 
They all come here, all our famous 
ones: Rock Hudson, Robert 
Mapplethorpe, Rudolph Nureyev comes 
here, Fassbinder, Foucoult. It's 
absolutely without question the place 
in the universe for someone like you. 
Anything goes.
FREDDIE 
You know, despite my stage persona, 
I’m still really a very shy boy. 
PAUL PRENTER 
Oh this place’ll cure you of all that. 
Life-changing. Trust me. And!--and I 
can even get you your own key to the 
private VIP room downstairs. Almost 
no-one gets their own key! 
They cross the ROAD and PAUL gets FREDDIE entry, straight 
away. 
INT. NY GAY LEATHER CLUB (MINESHAFT) - DAY 
A WILD PARTY. The DISCO ERA has ARRIVED. FREDDIE, in a 
corner, SNORTS a HUGE LINE OF COKE... 
CAMERA goes into an E.C.U on his face as he whispers - 
FREDDIE 
...Bis--millah! 
The DECADENCE in the room is pronounced. And then - 
- FREDDIE is presented with a KEY. FREDDIE looks at the 
KEY, and takes it, and mock bows in thanks. 
FREDDIE 
My own key! 
CUT TO: 
SHOT OF: a BASEMENT CORRIDOR - the CAMERA tracks in on a 
DOOR at the far end...one with a LARGE KEY-HOLE... 
EXT. NY GAY LEATHER CLUB (MINESHAFT) - SUNRISE 
FREDDIE and PAUL and two other GAY CLONES emerge, HIGH and 
RAUCOUS. They head off down the street.

We HEAR: as SOUNDTRACK: “I WANT IT ALL”. 
EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT - SUNRISE 
BLOODY MEAT CARCASSES are being loaded into REFRIGERATED 
TRUCKS by burly MEAT-PACKERS. 
MEAT-PACKER 1 
Hey! 
Six MEAT-PACKERS turn and see FREDDIE and his GANG walking 
toward them. The MEAT-PACKERS, some with HOOKS, move to cut 
off FREDDIE’s path as FREDDIE’s GANG stop before them. 
MEAT-PACKER 2 
What the fuck do we have here? 
PAUL PRENTER 
(afraid) 
No problem. Freddie? Come on. 
But FREDDIE, high as a kite, refuses to be dragged away by 
PAUL. A fight seems inevitable. 
FREDDIE 
I love it. It’s like West Side story. 
MEAT-PACKER 3 
You guys sure picked the wrong street 
to walk down. 
FREDDIE 
Oh, I don’t know about that. Lovely 
bunch of beefy boys like you... 
PAUL PRENTER 
Come on! 
PRENTER pulls FREDDIE away and he and the CLONES beat it- 
FREDDIE, laughing, flying... 
INT. HOTEL/ US TOUR 2 - SUNRISE 
BRIAN, in his BOXER SHORTS and T-SHIRTS, EAR-PLUGS 
inserted, carrying a BUCKET OF ICE, unable to sleep because 
of the PARTY MUSIC leaking from other rooms, walks down the 
HALL, returning to his room. When he turns the T-junction 
corner, he looks left and right - to the left, down the 
hall, he sees ROGER sneaking TWO WOMEN into his room - and 
to the right, down the hall, he sees FREDDIE leading PAUL 
PRENTER and the TWO GAY CLONES into his room.

BRIAN stands at the door of his room, looking for his door 
KEY, reflecting on what he has seen, when he see FREDDIE 
waving at him, leaning out of his room. BRIAN takes out his 
EAR-PLUGS - 
FREDDIE 
We’re having a party. Come have a 
drink, brother. 
BRIAN considers it - SHOULD HE JOIN HIS FRIEND? - but he 
finally declines, smiling as he shakes his head. BRIAN 
enters his hotel room instead. 
INT. BRIAN’S HOTEL ROOM/ US TOUR 2 - CONTINUOUS 
BRIAN enters and the room is empty. He stands there and 
listens to the sound of TWO PARTIES coming through the 
walls...Audible is the sound of Queen’s “FAT BOTTOMED 
GIRLS”... 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
Should I have gone into his room? 
Accepted him and his new world? 
We were worried--about the road he was 
going down--we’d promised to look out 
for him--but at the time we didn’t 
think there was anything we could do. 
(beat) 
Still, for all our problems, the hits 
kept coming. John Deacon wrote us the 
biggest hit we ever had in the United 
States... 
INT. STUDIO - DAY 
The BAND record the VIDEO for...”ANOTHER ONE BITES THE 
DUST”...FREDDIE in FULL GAY CLONE LOOK for this video... 
camping it up, strutting around in a bright yellow tank top 
and shorts with a baseball cap that has bull horns coming 
out of it! 
OLDER BRIAN 
Let’s just say the world in 1981 was 
so square that no-one who watched 
this video even guessed Freddie was 
the least bit gay!

EXT. SMALL GAY BAR / LONDON - NIGHT 
A TAXI pulls up and MARY gets out, WORRIED. She looks for 
FREDDIE who is hiding in the shadows across the road. She 
goes to him. He is sporting his CLONE LOOK. 
MARY 
What’s the emergency?! 
FREDDIE 
I need someone to go in there (gay 
club) with me. I can’t go in alone. 
MARY 
(outraged) 
Freddie?! I left David in the middle 
of dinner! 
FREDDIE 
He’s very short, isn’t he. Five foot 
six, seven? 
MARY 
How dare you! HOW DARE YOU! You know 
what? Find someone else. Call your PA! 
I’m sure PAUL is lurking close by. 
MARY walks off, looking for a new CAB. FREDDIE chases her 
and catches her. 
FREDDIE 
Mary! You’re here now. Just give me 
five minutes. Please! Please. 
(beat) 
I’ll pay you. 
This infuriates her further. 
MARY 
What’s happening to you? 
FREDDIE 
I can’t stand being alone right now. 
How do I look? My hair is so horrible 
and still fucking greasy! 
She regards him, with sympathy - and then softens. 
FREDDIE 
Ten minutes. Then you can go home to 
David in my Rolls Royce. I’m very 
happy for you. Really.

MARY 
Five. Five minutes. 
INT. SMALL GAY BAR / LONDON - NIGHT 
FREDDIE and MARY sit at the BAR, on stools. The room is 
full of GAY MEN, MARY is the only woman. FREDDIE keeps his 
CAP on, hiding his identity, as he waits to be picked up. 
MARY 
(sarcastic) 
Well, this feels natural. 
FREDDIE 
Must seen very strange to you, sorry 
darling. 
MARY 
You do this a lot? 
FREDDIE 
(nervous) 
Bars. Sometimes in the park, you know. 
MARY 
Have you heard from Joe? 
FREDDIE 
Love is Russian Roulette for me, with 
all the chambers loaded. So here I am. 
Sad, isn’t it, to only trust 
strangers. 
(beat) 
And you. 
(holds her hand) 
Do you love him? 
MARY 
He wants to have children.

And so you always just wait for 
someone to approach you? 
FREDDIE 
Absolutely. I’m not a tramp, darling! 
Can’t have them getting the wrong 
idea! 
They laugh - 
FREDDIE 
I love you.

MARY 
That’s the problem. 
As FREDDIE turns and looks around the room for 
CANDIDATES...a STOCKY IRISHMAN with a MUSTACHE (JIM HUTTON) 
comes to the bar, stands beside MARY. Their eyes meet - 
JIM HUTTON 
You don’t remember me? Probably the 
leather. You come to my salon. Never 
forget a hair-cut. 
MARY 
Oh hello. 
JIM HUTTON 
Jim. 
MARY 
Mary. And this is - 
(tapping FREDDIE’s 
shoulder) 
- this is--umm--ummm-- 
FREDDIE turns - FREDDIE and JIM look at each other - 
JIM HUTTON 
You can’t remember? 
MARY 
He goes by many names. 
JIM HUTTON 
A man of mystery then? 
FREDDIE 
(to JIM) 
How big’s your cock? 
MARY- shocked - turns to FREDDIE - 
MARY 
And that’s not giving them “the 
wrong idea”?! 
JIM HUTTON 
I was just going to offer you a 
drink and some conversation, I 
don’t give a fuck who you are—-you 
shouldn’t be rude. 
FREDDIE is startled to be spoken to like this -

MARY 
I like him. 
FREDDIE 
I like him too. 
MARY 
Great. Then I’ll leave you two to 
get to know each other. I have a 
spaghetti bolognese getting cold. 
MARY kisses FREDDIE on the cheek - 
MARY 
Bye Jim. 
MARY leaves the bar. 
JIM HUTTON 
So--Freddie--you wanna start again? 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
And then--at the height of our 
popularity--we screwed up. We recorded 
a video, dreamt up by Roger, for a new 
song that John wrote, but which 
everyone thought was Freddie’s idea... 
INT. SOUND-STAGE/ “BREAK FREE” VIDEO RECORDING - DAY 
As the CREW prepare to record the VIDEO - 
- FREDDIE sits in the MAKE-UP CHAIR, dressed in FULL DRAG 
and WIG: false NAILS, LASHES, BREASTS, SWEATER, MINISKIRT, 
LIP-STICK and MUSTACHE !!! 
PAUL PRENTER lights a cigarette for FREDDIE, and holds it 
to FREDDIE’s lips so the SUPER-STAR doesn’t have to muss up 
his false nails, which are just then drying. 
PAUL PRENTER 
How are you? 
FREDDIE 
I’m working too hard. Sometimes I feel 
I could just give it all up. Honestly. 
Tour, album, video, tour, album 
video... 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED)

PAUL PRENTER 
What you need to do? What you need to 
do--is go solo.
FREDDIE 
Not you now. 
PAUL PRENTER 
I’m serious. It’s so clear. You're the 
star. You’re the leader of Queen. 
FREDDIE 
Not “leader”, no. The most important 
person perhaps.
PAUL PRENTER 
Don’t want control over your life? 
Your schedule? 
FREDDIE doesn’t dismiss this... 
PAUL PRENTER 
When Jackson recorded “Thriller”? On 
his own? Not having to share it with 
his brothers? So much fucken money he 
didn’t have to tour. Didn’t have to 
tour. He toured when he wanted to 
tour. Only possible because it was a 
solo album. Freedom. 
FREDDIE 
(weakening) 
Well... 
PAUL PRENTER 
I can find a band for you anywhere. 
CBS records has been calling Miami 
every day begging you to do a solo 
deal. Plus, alone you’d be bigger and 
better than ever, and you wouldn’t 
have to deal with so many egos. 
(whispering) 
Freedom. To be Freddie Mercury. 
FREDDIE looks tempted, but then, grabs the CIG, and looks 
at his “BROTHERS.” 
FREDDIE 
Oh shut up.

QUEEN, dressed IN DRAG, record “I WANT TO BREAK FREE”. All 
the guys in WIGS, FALSE BREASTS, DRESSES, the 
works...until...the image FREEZE-FRAMES. Over this stamp a 
BANNER that reads: 
“BANNED!” 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
The video was banned. In the USA. And 
it was Freddie who got the blame. 
Never again would we tour there, or 
enjoy the same kind of success. 
INT. CBS HALLWAY - DAY 
FREDDIE and PAUL PRENTER and JIM BEACH walk toward an 
OFFICE DOOR...and as they do, the sound of MICHAEL 
JACKSON’s “THRILLER” gets louder and louder. 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
We killed the golden goose--and 
Freddie took it hardest...and reacted 
the most destructively... 
When a smiling SECRETARY opens the OFFICE door for them, 
they sweep in to meet... 
INT. CBS CEO’S (WALTER YETNIKOFF) OFFICE - DAY 
...WALTER YETNIKOFF, who rises from his chair to greet 
them. 
“THRILLER” is blaring from his Hi-Fi until his FINGER stops 
the TAPE-DECK - CLUNK! 
FREDDIE and JIM BEACH and PRENTER face YETNIKOFF (a small 
man with all of Manhattan behind him, who cuts hard SALAMI 
at his desk with a sharp knife that he routinely points at 
people.) 
YETNIKOFF 
Gentleman. Siddown. Siddown. 
FREDDIE looks around before he sits - it’s a SHRINE to 
MICHAEL JACKSON - FULL-SIZE CUT-OUTS of MJ, a POSTER-SIZED 
PHOTO of MJ and YETNIKOFF, MJ MEMORABILIA, DOLLS and other 
MERCHANDISING, etc - a huge INDUSTRY spawned by one artist! 
FREDDIE 
Perhaps we should kneel? 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
104.

YETNIKOFF 
Ha! Well, he’s a reliable artist. 
Gives his audience what they want, 
time after time. 
FREDDIE makes a little “SNORING” noise. 
YETNIKOFF 
That’s how you build a giant brand. 
FREDDIE does a little MOON-WALK and then an MJ SPIN, and 
then sits, staring at YETNIKOFF. 
YETNIKOFF 
So-- 
(beat) 
I’m good you’re good, give it to me 
straight. 
JIM BEACH 
A two-album deal, here at CBS. 
YETNIKOFF 
And you are? 
JIM BEACH 
Queen’s lawyer. 
PAUL PRENTER 
Jim Beach. Freddie gets creative 
control. He’s the biggest act in the 
world and you know it. 
YETNIKOFF 
Michael Jackson is the biggest 
act in the world. 
PAUL PRENTER 
How would you like another Michael 
Jackson? 
YETNIKOFF 
Don’t try to shake me down. 
I served in the US army and I’ve faced 
down Russian tanks across Check-Point 
Charlie--they blinked first. 
YETNIKOFF offers them a piece of SALAMI on the end of his 
knife... All shake their heads. 
FREDDIE 
I like my sausage warm. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
105.

YETNIKOFF 
And that means...precisely? 
FREDDIE 
What it says. Single-entendre, dear. 
YETNIKOFF stares at FREDDIE - eats the SALAMI himself. 
YETNIKOFF 
So--what kinda albums? 
FREDDIE 
Disco. 
YETNIKOFF 
Disco? Mmkay. 
FREDDIE 
And opera. The second album. 
YETNIKOFF 
Like Bo Rhapsody? Opera. Like - 
FREDDIE 
No. No. Like... 
FREDDIE turns on a PORTABLE TAPE DECK. We hear the sound of 
MONTSERAT CABALLE, the great diva, singing. FREDDIE turns 
it off. 
FREDDIE 
...pure opera. A collaboration. With 
that voice. Isn’t she remarkable? 
Montserat Cabballe, the finest 
soprano in the world. And I. 
(STRIKING AN OPERATIC 
POSE) 
YETNIKOFF 
Is he kidding? 
PRENTER and JIM BEACH shake their heads. 
YETNIKOFF 
Opera? I’d rather have an album that’s 
just the sound of two dogs fucking. 
FREDDIE 
Well, if you want to make it a three 
album deal... 
YETNIKOFF is not amused. Points his knife at REID - 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
106.

YETNIKOFF 
Two disco albums. And fast--disco’s a 
bubble. Gonna pop any day, you kiddin’ 
me? And no opera. Understood? 
YETNIKOFF passes JIM BEACH a deal memo. JIM BEACH reads 
it...then looks at FREDDIE and PRENTER, who wait for 
PRENTER to speak... 
INT. FREDDIE’S MANSION/ LONDON - DAY 
FREDDIE is writing “I WAS BORN TO LOVE YOU” alone, on his 
PIANO... 
FREDDIE 
“I was born to love you with every 
single beat of my heart 
Yes I was born to take care of you 
Every single day of my life...” 
PAUL PRENTER, enters - 
PAUL PRENTER 
Freddie! It’s - 
ROGER, BRIAN and JOHN then all burst in together, angry and 
hurt - 
ROGER 
When were you going to tell us?! 
When the album comes out?! 
BRIAN 
Jim Beach said something. We thought 
he was joking. Is he joking? He said: 
“You better talk to Freddie.” 
ROGER 
A solo album? 
FREDDIE 
Actually, two. It’s no big deal. 
JOHN 
Two?! So what, that’s it?! 
ROGER 
How much? What did they pay you? 
What did they pay you? 
CONTINUED: (3) 
(CONTINUED) 
107.

FREDDIE 
Four million dollars. 
(a proud smile) 
Not bad--you have to admit. But I’m 
worth it. I’ll be bigger 
than Jackson apparently. 
The BAND stares at FREDDIE in shock - 
JOHN 
That’s more than any Queen deal. 
FREDDIE 
We need a break anyway. Album, tour, 
ab aeterno--it’s killing us. 
ROGER 
No, no, you’re killing us. 
FREDDIE 
Let’s take some tea in the garden. 
But first I want to play you 
something new. Listen to this - 
ROGER 
Jesus Christ, Fred! You have to snap 
out of this! We’re talking about - 
But FREDDIE has turned back to the piano and resumed 
playing “I WAS BORN TO LOVE YOU” - 
- ROGER, insulted, sweeps FREDDIE’s SONG NOTATION PAPERS 
onto the floor. FREDDIE glares at him. 
FREDDIE 
We can’t stand each other right now, 
admit it! And we’re not touring thanks 
to this fiasco in the US... 
BRIAN 
One video was banned. We could tour. 
FREDDIE 
MTV banned our video!!! The youth of 
America! We helped give birth to MTV! 
I’m never touring in the US again! 
And! And I’m being blamed for it, 
dear, not you, whose idea I believe it 
was to dress up in drag! 
(to BRIAN) 
And not you! 
(to JOHN)

Not even you, who wrote the goddamn 
song! No. “Crazy cross-dressing 
Freddie”! “Freddie The Fag” - coast to 
coast. “Freddie the Freak”! 
ROGER 
You loved the idea. 
PAUL PRENTER 
It’s what Freddie wants. He has to 
move on now. 
ROGER, BRIAN and JOHN glare at PAUL. 
FREDDIE 
Come on, you must all want a break, 
from the arguments--what songs get on 
the album, whose song should be the 
single, what’s on the B-side, who 
wrote what, who gets to earn the most 
money - 
BRIAN 
We’re a family. 
FREDDIE 
No we’re not, dear. It’s alright for 
you--Roger--John--you’ve all got kids, 
real family. What have I got down the 
road? I’m this or nothing! 
ROGER 
You were running a stall in Kensington 
Market before we gave you a chance! 
FREDDIE 
And without me you’d be a dentist 
playing blues on the weekend at the 
Crown and Anchor! 
(to BRIAN) 
And you’d be Dr Brian May, with a nice 
little PHD, winner of the faculty 
prize for the best hair on campus! 
ROGER 
You owe us loyalty! Allegiance! Even 
though you clearly don’t feel any! 
BRIAN 
You really think we’re nothing without 
you?

FREDDIE 
You’re something--I made you great! 
ROGER 
Believe this guy? 
BRIAN 
Come on, you’re better than this. You 
really are. 
JOHN 
If your album’s a flop, our entire 
backlist gets dragged down with you, 
devalued. Your fate is our fate, 
whether you like it or not. 
FREDDIE 
Spoken like an accountant--sorry John, 
but Christ Wept! 
(to them all) 
You don’t understand me anymore. 
It’s a shame. 
(to PAUL, fluttering 
his fingers) 
Paul? Pick this up. 
PAUL picks up the fallen PAPERS, as FREDDIE lights a 
cigarette. 
FREDDIE 
Oh don’t look so glum. No-one died. 
(puffing) 
It’s only rock and roll, for heavens 
sake. 
ROGER 
Queen is dead.
FREDDIE 
Give her a kiss one day, she might 
wake up... 
As FREDDIE smokes, looking at his BAND-MATES, egotistically 
brushing this off... 
FREDDIE

OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
He ran away. Moved to Munich. We lost 
him.

INT. MUNICH OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT 
FREDDIE watches, with PAUL PRENTER, a German-language 
production of “THE RING CYCLE” by WAGNER, a SCENE of 
TREACHERY and BETRAYAL. 
The ORCHESTRA rises to a CLIMAX. The CONDUCTOR urges his 
players on... 
ANGLE ON: FREDDIE, rapt, spell-bound - 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
But now he had to deliver on two solo 
albums, two disco albums, that would 
repay the enormous advance the record 
company had paid, and he’d never 
recorded on his own before. 
INT. FREDDIE’S MUNICH FLAT - DAY 
FREDDIE tries to write songs - and to inspire him he knocks 
back vodkas. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL PRENTER on the phone to someone - 
PRENTER

He can’t talk now. He’s working. He 
works day and night. 
INT. MARY’S NEW FLAT - NIGHT 
MARY puts down the phone - upset, as her BOYFRIEND, DAVE 
enters with FLOWERS. She tries to smile as he kisses her. 
INT. FREDDIE’S MUNICH FLAT - DAY 
FREDDIE, looking TIRED, rises from his COMPOSITIONS and 
goes to a silver case on the sideboard and scoops COCAINE 
onto the glass surface. 
INT. MUNICH NIGHT-CLUB - NIGHT 
FREDDIE knocks back VODKAS with PAUL PRENTER and several 
NEW FACES - shouting over the LOUD MUSIC...

FREDDIE 
Listen to that! That’s the sound I 
want! The sound of--youth, the sound 
of youth! It’s that! Pleasure! 
Indulgence! Hedonism! Ecstacy! 
ECSTACY! 
The MUSIC in the CLUB is DANCE/DISCO, heavy on synthesizers 
- far from the Queen sound. 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO (MUNICH) - DAY 
FREDDIE’s new session band stands around waiting to be told 
what to play - Fred Mandel, Paul Vincent, Curt Cress, 
Stephan Wissnet...but FREDDIE is drunk. 
FREDDIE 
Well, let’s just fucking try it again, 
yes? Because right now it’s so bad I 
can’t even recognise it as being the 
worst song I’ve ever written! Is any 
of this getting lost in translation? 
Mac? Do we need to hire a translator? 
He turns to MAC, the GERMAN ENGINEER/PRODUCER - in the 
CONTROL ROOM. 
MAC 
Freddie. We should go again. 
FREDDIE 
Ja! We should go again! Danke! Then 
let’s--jolly well--go again. 
The BAND all pull on their CANS and go again - the DISCOORIENTED 
intro to “LIVING ON MY OWN.” 
CUT TO: 
FREDDIE, taking time out, COUGHING and drinking VODKA and 
SMOKING to sooth his throat, while the BAND records.

No, no--completely take out the 
drums for the first twelve bars - 
MAC 
Take them out?
FREDDIE 
Take them out, gone--just the vocal 
for the first two lines, try that. 
Something has to work.

FREDDIE records his lead vocal - (We don’t hear the backing 
track) 
FREDDIE 
“Sometime I feel I’m gonna break 
down and cry, Nowhere to go nothing 
to do with my time, I get lonely, 
so lonely, Living on my own...” 
He starts to COUGH. He grabs a napkin. He coughs up BLOOD. 
MAC 
Freddie?

“Living On My Own”, we cut to - 
INT. FREDDIE’S MUNICH FLAT - NIGHT 
A PARTY at FREDDIE’s FLAT. PAUL PRENTER and a coterie of

PAUL leads a GROUPIE into a BACK-ROOM, where -

PAUL PRENTER 
May I introduce you to our record 
executives. Everyone, this is Holly. 
She’s a big fan of Freddie Mercury. 
The GROUPIE goes up to the first one and gets on her knees. 
CUT TO: 
The PARTY is winding down. While some of the REVELLERS now 
sleep in each others arms, entwined - 
- FREDDIE, drunk and high, tries to WRITE LYRICS and 
compose a new song - getting nowhere. 
He stops and picks up a candle and goes to inspect the 
SLEEPING REVELLERS. 
Down the HALLWAY comes the GROUPIE, pulling on her coat. 
GROUPIE 
I only missed one--he left early. 
FREDDIE 
Don’t worry--I got him before he left. 
FREDDIE winks at her, and gives a sad little smile, before

FREDDIE’S solo album, is on sale, price already reduced. 
OLDER BRIAN 
His solo album? Flopped. You only have

1985. YOUNG BRIAN watches the TV - a news item on ROCK

We failed him. We promised to be 
there for him. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
And where were we, his family who 
should have gone to his rescue? 
We were too English to tell him we 
were worried about the road he was 
going down, or that we felt sad, that 
we were hurting. So Freddie just hid 
from us, assuming we disapproved. We 
didn’t, but we didn’t tell him.

relationships in basements chasing 
barmaids, strippers, “angels with

Queen-- 
FREDDIE 
(interested) 
Mmmm? 
PRENTER 
(dismissively) 
--have been invited to perform, called 
“Live Aid”, part of a line-up of other 
bands. Charity thing, linked to that 
Christmas single, “Do They Know It’s 
Christmas”, on which you were not 
invited to sing! Now they want to do a 
concert for Africa--they’re desperate, 
need as many bands as they can get. 
FREDDIE 
How flattering. What-- 
(clearly interested) 
--do the others say? 
PRENTER 
I’m presuming they’ll do anything. 
They didn’t want you, now they’re 
desperate. 
FREDDIE 
Then tell them--tell them to use all 
the singers they invited to do the 
fucking single! 
PRENTER walks off - pleased with the result.

The DOORBELL sounds. FREDDIE (drunk, high and looking worn 
out) goes to it, and opens the door. 
It’s MARY! Her shoulders are coated in SNOW. She carries a

for a PARTY of some size. 
MARY 
I haven’t heard from you. I phoned and 
phoned. I was worried about you. And 
last night I had a terrible dream, 
that something bad had happened - 
FREDDIE clears away a few bottles and party detritus - 
FEMALE and MALE clothing items (a feather boa, a carnival 
mask, a top hat, a mirror with residue of coke still on it) 
- 
FREDDIE 
No! Nothing bad has happened. 
Quite the contrary. 
MARY 
You look pale. And sad. 
He does look unwell - 
FREDDIE 
I’ve been up all night--working, 
that’s all. Wait till you hear what 
I’m doing now! It’s remarkable! 
MARY looks at the PIANO, which is coated in MANUSCRIPT and 
LYRIC PAPERS, CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES, half-filled glasses. 
MARY 
You look - 
FREDDIE 
I’m eating better. 
MARY

FREDDIE 
Do I? I wish everybody would stop 
saying that. It’s so depressing.

INT. FREDDIE’S MUNICH FLAT - NIGHT 
- MARY takes off the HEADPHONES. Silence. She SMILES. 
MARY 
I do. 
FREDDIE 
It’s good, isn’t it?! It’s really 
good! 
MARY 
But I thought CBS has forbidden an 
opera record. 
FREDDIE 
Sshhh. They have. But I’ll pay for 
it myself. 
(overjoyed) 
It’s so great to have you here. 
Mary--I need you. Stay. Stay here, 
with me, just till I finish the 
album! Two months! Just you and I! 
Your own bedroom. 
He grabs her SUITCASE and carries it into a SPARE BEDROOM 
and then re-appears. She still looks uncertain - 
FREDDIE 
Say “Yes.” You can help me work, you 
can be my inspiration. 
(tenderly) 
I need the love of my life. 
She melts - 
MARY 
Oh Freddie... 
He kneels at her feet, holds her hands - 
MARY 
I don’t want to sit here and watch 
you hurt yourself. All the parties, 
drugs, strange people - 
FREDDIE 
No. No, no, no. I’ll work. I’ll 
just work, that’s all. Live a quiet 
life, we’ll look after each other 
and become vegan missionaries until 
the album is done. 
(CONTINUED) 
121.

MARY 
Work? And nothing else? Mr Mercury? 
FREDDIE 
I promise. Oh, and people call me 
“Your Royal Highness” now. 
MARY 
I’m sure they do. 
She smiles. He smiles too, freely, not covering his teeth. 
FREDDIE 
I’ll show you! I’m gonna start now, 
prove it to you! Just watch! Work! 
He goes to the piano, while she sits on the LOUIS XIV 
CHAISE LONGUE. 
FREDDIE 
Total dedication! 
(sings) 
“Just you wait ‘enry ‘iggins just 
you wait.” 
He resumes work on a new song - 
FREDDIE 
I’m working on another piece to 
suit Monserat’s voice. Can you 
imagine? Writing for the most 
divine voice on earth? 
MARY 
(tired) 
That’s good Freddie. That’s good. 
FREDDIE starts to read the music of “ENSUENO”, and we hear 
both PIANO and VOCALS on the SOUNDTRACK as he reads - 
FREDDIE 
A piano introduction, in E/m... 
(we hear this) 
and then...change, B7B9... 
(and this) 
...and then, her voice...Octave 
higher! E/m... 
We hear MONSERAT’s voice come in...Over her lines Freddie 
mutters - 
FREDDIE 
“En mi sueno re vi...” 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
122.

- and then POUNDING on the DOOR. FREDDIE stops. 
FREDDIE opens the door, and PAUL PRENTER and the REVELLERS 
(MEN and WOMEN) all push into FREDDIE’s FLAT. 
PAUL PRENTER 
Sorry we’re late! 
(seeing MARY) 
Oh! Mary! What a pleasant surprise! 
PAUL goes to MARY and kisses her on the cheek. 
PAUL PRENTER 
What brings you here? Should have 
told us you were coming--What 
hotel are you staying at? 
MARY starts to put on her COAT, making to leave again - 
FREDDIE 
Mary? Come on. 
MARY 
Bye Freddie. 
FREDDIE 
Mary... 
(deciding who he 
wants) 
Paul! Everyone, you have to leave. 
REVELLERS 
LEAVE?! 
FREDDIE 
Everyone out. OUT! Out, out! 
PAUL PRENTER 
Well you heard him. Everyone out! 
Out! Out! 
PAUL herds the REVELLERS out and shuts the door. 
PAUL PRENTER 
There. That’s better. 
FREDDIE looks at MARY to see if she’s happy now - 
MARY 
Him too. (Paul)
FREDDIE 
Mary - 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
123.

MARY 
Him too. I’m not staying if he’s here. 
FREDDIE 
Paul. You need to go. 
PAUL PRENTER 
For how long? 
FREDDIE 
(to MARY) 
How long? 
MARY 
We don’t need him anymore. 
PAUL PRENTER 
What’s going on? Fred? 
FREDDIE looks at PAUL - but can’t say the words - so MARY 
steps up and confronts PAUL herself - 
MARY 
We don’t need you. In fact, ever 
since you showed up you’ve been 
looking after yourself. You don’t 
care about him. 
(to FRED) 
He’s using you. He’s been cutting 
you off from all the people who 
truly care about you. It’s sick! 
PAUL PRENTER 
I take orders from Freddie. 
(to FREDDIE) 
You want this? Seriously? 
(to MARY) 
He’s going to be the biggest act 
in the world. And I’m gonna help 
him get there. So maybe it’s you 
who should go. 
MARY looks at FREDDIE to say something - 
FREDDIE 
Please. It’s going to be fine. 
MARY goes to the BEDROOM. 
FREDDIE 
Fuck. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
(CONTINUED) 
124.

PAUL PRENTER 
Freddie, listen to me, she’s trying 
to pull everything down we’ve built up- 
-She’s jealous. 
MARY comes out of the BEDROOM with her suitcase, and goes 
to the door. 
FREDDIE 
Mary--stop this--you’re not going 
anywhere. 
MARY 
Goodbye Freddie. 
The door slams. MARY is gone. FREDDIE looks at PAUL. 
PAUL PRENTER 
I don’t know what she was thinking, 
coming here. What a scene! 
FREDDIE goes to the window to see - 
- MARY walking off, through the VIRGIN SNOW, with her 
SUITCASE. 
FREDDIE 
You’re out, Paul. It’s over. Things 
have to change. 
PAUL PRENTER 
You’re firing me? 
FREDDIE 
I’m firing you! Yes! Be gone before I 
come back! 
FREDDIE grabs his coat - 
PAUL PRENTER 
With everything I know? With all the 
photographs I have of Mr Freddie 
Mercury? 
FREDDIE 
Careful! Be very careful! I used to 
box in school--still have the trophy! 
Do not! Mess! With me! 
PAUL PRENTER 
You’re blaming me for everything? 
CONTINUED: (4) 
(CONTINUED) 
125.

FREDDIE 
No, I blame myself! I made a monster, 
used every trick in the book on myself 
and I fell for it all - lights! 
camera! action! - because, truth is, I 
don’t much like myself--so I made a 
monster--but one so damn big I don’t 
have the strength to play him most of 
the time! Blame myself for something 
else too, for being weak--too weak to 
realise the first thing you attract, 
when you go rotten, is fruit-flies, 
attracted by the decay, dirty little 
fruit flies... 
FREDDIE’s face is only inches from PRENTERS now... 
FREDDIE 
...coming to feast on what’s left. 
Well, there isn’t much left anymore, 
Paul, so do what you like with your 
little photos and anecdotes - “Freddie 
did this - “, “Freddie did that - “-- 
Get a good price, and then make sure I 
never see your supercilious little 
fucking face again or I will knock you 
down and you will stay down! 
FREDDIE now runs out the door... 
EXT. STREET/ MUNICH - DAY 
MARY gets on a TRAM and the TRAM pulls away, revealing - 
FREDDIE, slipping and sliding through the snow. 
He can only watch as the TRAM pulls away. Up with MUSIC: as 
SOUNTRACK: “THE SHOW MUST GO ON”... 
INT. FREDDIE’S MUNICH FLAT - DAY 
FREDDIE, alone now, at rock bottom, tries to work but 
cannot. He paces. He goes to a GLASS COFFEE TABLE and 
spoons some COKE onto the GLASS, and BEGINS to CUT a HUGE 
LINE...He SNORTS it all. But it only makes him more 
JITTERY... 
CONTINUED: (5) 
(CONTINUED) 
126.

On the EDGE of the GLASS TABLE he nervously begins to play 
PHANTOM PIANO...but then - for the first time - STOPS 
HIMSELF, looks at his tense fingers, forms a fist, and 
resists this nervous tic. 
CUT TO: 
FREDDIE is watching the GERMAN TV...when he sees his FACE 
on the SCREEN... 
It’s a NEWS-REPORT (In GERMAN) about him...PICTURES of MEN, 
FREDDIE doing DRUGS, PARTY SHOTS...before the NEWS-STORY 
cuts to - 
- PAUL PRENTER, being interviewed (We clearly hear HIS 
ENGLISH playing under the GERMAN TRANSLATION)... 
FREDDIE rubs his eyes - is this an HALLUCINATION? 
Cut back and forth between FREDDIE’s perspiring face and 
SOUND-BITES of the PRENTER interview - 
PAUL PRENTER 
(on TV) 
“his lovers, they were 
countless”...”drug-fuelled parties 
that went on for days”...”but to me he 
remained a frightened little boy from 
Zanzibar”...”the relationship with 
Mary, that was just a cover”...”they 
paid him $4 million for his first solo 
album, which of course failed”... 
The item ends. FREDDIE gets up and starts to roam the room 
- and then he starts SMASHING THINGS, all his priceless 
ANTIQUES, all his acquisitions - finally even driving his 
KNEE into the TV (which fails to break the TV SCREEN, only 
making it fall over) which INJURES his KNEE. He SHOUTS in 
PAIN and then falls back on the FLOOR, among the 
ruins...gripping his DAMAGED KNEE... 
...and here, after staring at the chandeliers above, he 
rolls onto his side and sees a LAST PILE of COCAINE, lying 
on broken glass. He LICKS his fingers and gathers up the 
COCAINE and puts it into his MOUTH. 
He then lies there on the carpet, on his face...running his 
FINGERS through his GREASY HAIR, before his FINGERS then 
play PHANTOM PIANO on his chest, muttering some MELODY... 
CUT TO: 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
127.

DAYS LATER. FREDDIE sitting on a chair, NAKED under a SHEET 
WRAPPED AROUND HIM, in a terrible, unshaven state. He gets 
up and crosses the room. On the PIANO lies a CD of “MR BAD 
BUY” - he looks at the CD, then throws it across the 
room... 
FADE TO BLACK 
INT. JIM BEACH’S OFFICE - DAY 
JIM BEACH picks up the phone. 
JIM BEACH 
(into phone) 
Hello? (beat) Freddie? 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO/ MUNICH - DAY 
FREDDIE cradles the phone - nervous, playing PHANTOM 
PIANO, humble now... 
FREDDIE 
I need to sue. To sue Prenter. Need 
you to set that up. OK? 
JIM BEACH 
Where are you? I’ve been calling you 
in Munich. Tell me where you are? 
FREDDIE 
There was this Africa concert, that 
wants Queen to play. What, um...Is 
that still...?
JIM BEACH 
Too late. They’ve announced the acts 
already. Tickets sold. Fred? 
Are you in Munich? 
FREDDIE 
Miami--I need to connect again with 
the Mothership. 
(smiles sadly) 
Do you think you could organise a 
meeting? Would they--would they come, 
do you think? 
JIM BEACH 
They’re still very upset. They don’t 
really want anything to do with you 
I’m afraid. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED)

FREDDIE 
Oh. If you ask them, they’ll meet me. 
Tell them I want to talk, just talk. 
We’re family, you know? Family have 
fights...all the time... 
JIM BEACH 
I don’t know Freddie. 
FREDDIE lights a cigarette - 
MUSIC UP: “UNDER PRESSURE” by FREDDIE MERCURY/DAVID BOWIE. 
EXT. CAR-PARK/ MONT-PELERIN HOTEL - MONTREUX - DAY 
FREDDIE’s LIMO arrives in the ALPINE RESORT - JIM BEACH is 
waiting for him. FREDDIE is LIMPING, as a result of his 
KNEE INJURY. They shake hands. 
FREDDIE 
Are the others here? 
JIM indicates FOUR OTHER LIMOUSINES. JIM and FREDDIE enter 
the hotel. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM / MONT-PELERIN HOTEL - MONTREUX - DAY 
FREDDIE and JIM wait in a room. FREDDIE is pacing, limping, 
nervously. We haven’t seen him like this. 
FREDDIE 
You said they were here. 
JIM BEACH 
They’re here--somewhere. Wait here. 
JIM BEACH exits. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 2 / MONT-PELERIN HOTEL - MONTREUX - DAY 
JOHN and ROGER and BRIAN sit in a LARGE SUITE. JIM BEACH 
enters... 
JIM BEACH 
He’s here. 
JOHN and ROGER and BRIAN look at each other - 
BRIAN 
Let him wait.

No-one moves. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM / MONT-PELERIN HOTEL - MONTREUX - DAY 
FREDDIE can’t stand the pressure - he paces, until JIM 
BEACH enters. 
FREDDIE 
Where are they?
JIM BEACH 
They’re coming. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
Hadn’t we waited for him? We 
were angry. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM / MONT-PELERIN HOTEL - MONTREUX - DAY 
The entire BAND and JIM BEACH face each other. A brittle 
silence... 
JIM BEACH 
Who wants to go first? 
JOHN 
Well, I have an announcement. I’m 
leaving the band - 
They all stare at him - 
JOHN 
- to become a record executive at 
EMI. 
JIM BEACH 
Thankyou John for the levity. Well, 
I’ll start - 
FREDDIE 
No. I’ll start. I’ll start. I’ve been 
hideous. I know I have. And I deserve 
your wrath. I know that. I’ve been a 
conceited selfish...well, an asshole, 
basically. 
ROGER 
Strong beginning. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
130.

FREDDIE 
Now I’m happy to strip off my shirt 
and flagellate myself before you or, 
or I could ask a simple question. 
JOHN 
I’m good with the flagellation. 
FREDDIE 
What will it take for you all to 
forgive me? 
BRIAN 
Is that what you want, Freddie? I 
forgive you. Is that it, can we go 
now? 
JIM BEACH 
What Freddie wants is - 
ROGER 
- Why don’t we let Freddie tell us 
what he wants. 
FREDDIE 
Queen. I want Queen. I tried to give 
Michael Jackson a run for his money 
but turns out he’s faster than he 
looks. I hired a great band, fine 
musicians that would do exactly what I 
told them, and the big problem was 
they did exactly what I told them. 
Without the sparks, no fire--No fire? 
No magic. No surprises. Without Roger 
contradicting me, I found I couldn’t 
concentrate. Without Brian telling me 
to do it his way, I couldn’t work out 
what I wanted. Without John giving me 
“that look” I could never reach a 
decision. I need the Mothership. I 
always did. I need my family back. And 
right now, my dears, I need you more 
than you can possibly imagine. So. 
Name your terms. 
ROGER 
Could you step out of the room for a 
second, Fred? 
FREDDIE, surprised, does so. The door closes. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
131.

BRIAN 
(to ROGER) 
What? 
ROGER 
Just fucking with him. 
JIM BEACH 
Shall...I get him back in? 
After a long silence, the BAND nod. FREDDIE re-enters. 
ROGER 
We decided...what did we decide? 
JOHN 
We decided things need to change. 
From now on, everything gets shared 
evenly. Doesn’t matter who writes the 
song, it’s a Queen song. Four ways 
evenly. 
FREDDIE 
Done. 
ROGER 
And we have a problem with the team 
of people you have around you. 
FREDDIE 
Paul is out. I fired him. 
JOHN 
On what pretext? 
FREDDIE 
Villainy. 
(to JIM BEACH) 
Light me a cigarette would you Miami? 
JIM lights a cigarette - 
FREDDIE 
What else? 
BRIAN 
Bob Geldoff. He keeps phoning. 
FREDDIE 
How did I offend him?

ROGER 
Wants to squeeze us into the line-up 
for “Live Aid”. 
JOHN 
As an after-thought! 
ROGER 
He wants an answer now. He swears 
a lot. 
They look at each other - lots of shrugs, uncertainty, 
fear... 
JOHN 
Every ticket is already sold. So if 
we do it, not one in the audience 
will’ve paid to see us. 
ROGER 
And any fans will’ve forgotten who 
we are anyway.
JOHN 
Plus--we haven’t played together 
for 3 years. Kinda suicide to play 
again for the first time in front of 
thousands... 
ROGER 
...Millions. 
BRIAN 
Yes or no? 
FREDDIE 
It’s a chance to remind them who 
we are. 
ROGER 
And who are we? 
FREDDIE 
We--we are the most preposterous 
rock band in the history of the world 
--and don’t you fucking forget it! 
FREDDIE grins and covers his teeth with his hand.

ROGER 
Okay, let’s try again. 
(taps his drumsticks) 
...two...three... 
The BAND begin to PLAY “HAMMER TO FALL” - but they are too 
RUSTY, and only play a few BARS before they have to stop. 
FREDDIE 
Truly dreadful. Go again. 
BRIAN 
It’s been a while. 
FREDDIE 
We have, what? A twenty minute set? 
Miami, dear? They’ve given us a 
twenty minute set? 
JIM BEACH steps forward. 
JIM BEACH 
Everyone gets twenty. Jagger, Bowie, 
Elton, McCartney. Twenty minutes to 
rock the world. Just had some numbers, 
guys. Listen up. 72,000 people here in 
London, 100,000 to gather in 
Philadelphia, watching on giant screen 
via live telecast, and a global TV 
audience of 2 billion across 150 
countries. No pressure. 
The band gulp and nod. Silence, then - 
ROGER 
Okay.
(tapping his sticks) 
Two...three... 
They START to PLAY again... 
CUT TO: 
FREDDIE takes a smoke-break. JIM BEACH approaches with a 
piece of paper. 
JIM BEACH 
Message for you. 
FREDDIE reads it. He looks up at JIM BEACH, troubled. 
FREDDIE

UP WITH: “WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER”... 
FREDDIE and JIM BEACH are led up a CORRIDOR by a NURSE. 
They stop outside a PRIVATE ROOM. 
FREDDIE 
(to JIM) 
Wait for me here. 
The NURSE walks away. FREDDIE prepares himself, then pushes 
open the door and enters. 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM / LONDON HOSPITAL - DAY 
PLAY on FREDDIE’s face and emotions as he approaches a bed 
where a MAN (JOE BASTIN, his former lover) lies in a COMA. 
FREDDIE breathes deeply. 
FREDDIE 
Ohhh Joe. 
He sits and, finally touches JOE’s hand. 
FREDDIE 
Handsome Joe. 
Kind Joe. 
CLOSE ON: JOE BASTIN, the last phase of HIV/AIDS. Skin and 
bone. A woolen cap on his head. Breathing assisted by tubes 
to his nose. 
FREDDIE has tears falling from his eyes. He leans in and 
kisses JOE’s head, then rises and leaves the room. 
INT. BATHROOM/ LONDON HOSPITAL - DAY 
FREDDIE washes his HANDS thoroughly...then pauses to 
EXAMINE his ARMS, turning them over, looking for possible 
LESIONS, of which he finds none.

INT. WAITING ROOM/ DOCTOR’S SURGERY - DAY 
(On another day) - FREDDIE, wearing sunglasses, cap, waits 
nervously, beside JIM HUTTON (on one side) and a YOUNG HIV 
MAN (on the other). 
YOUNG HIV MAN 
(to FREDDIE) 
Hey. 
FREDDIE looks at the YOUNG HIV MAN, gives a quick smile, 
then LOWERS his CAP over his eyes and adjusts his 
SUNGLASSES, fearful of being recognised. Silence, until - 
- NURSE 2 appears... 
NURSE 2 
Doctor will see you now. 
JIM taps FREDDIE on the knee supportively, then FREDDIE 
follows the NURSE, until - 
YOUNG HIV MAN 
Day-O. 
FREDDIE turns, the YOUNG HIV MAN is looking at him... 
FREDDIE 
(touched) 
Day-O 
FREDDIE enters the SURGERY, the door closes behind him. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
FREDDIE emerges - stay on his face as he processes the 
news...hard to tell what he’s thinking, feeling... 
INT. REHEARSAL ROOM/ LONDON - DAY 
For their 2nd “LIVE AID” rehearsal, the BAND are now 
rehearsing “CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE” and really 
rocking it now. They have gelled again, but... 
FREDDIE is off, troubled, in poor voice, weak... 
BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN all notice and look at each other, 
wondering what is up with FREDDIE?

INT. FREDDIE’S MANSION/ LONDON - DAY 
FREDDIE sits at his BREAKFAST table, staring out the window 
at his beautiful garden...where JIM HUTTON tends the 
FLOWERS. 
MARY enters - PREGNANT - bringing a steaming cup. 
MARY 
Here. Try and drink this? Lemon 
and honey. How is it? (the throat) 
FREDDIE 
Not good. And my knee is killing me 
too. I’m not sure I can do it, 
Mary-kins. I’m serious.

MARY turns on the TV set. 
MARY 
The show starts in a few minutes. 
The PICTURE shows...the waiting WEMBLEY CROWD... 
FREDDIE 
I’m going for a walk. 
EXT. FREDDIE’S MANSION/ STREETS OF LONDON - DAY 
FREDDIE emerges and walks up the street, wearing CAP and 
SUNGLASSES and a LARGE COAT. A lonely man. 
When the SUN falls on him, he stops, turns his face toward 
the healing sun, closing his eyes, trying to make sense of 
everything... 
He then looks around him, up and down the street. WHERE 
THE HELL IS EVERYONE? The streets of London are empty! 
Suddenly - the ROAR OF A CROWD. Where is it coming from? 
ELECTRIC GUITARS then augment the ROAR... 
FREDDIE looks around, and realises that the sound is coming 
from OPEN WINDOWS... 
...and then from the sole PASSING CAR, which is playing the 
SAME ROCK MUSIC (the telecast/broadcast from LIVE AID)... 
FREDDIE goes to investigate...advances up the front steps 
of the nearest HOUSE...Reaching the top step he sees in the 
OPEN WINDOW to a FAMILY - gathered around their TV - (as 
STATUS QUO plays “Rockin’ All Over The World.”) 
CLOSE ON: FREDDIE’s POV of the FAMILY...

Abandoned places - I guess we know the

On and on, does anybody know what we

“Another hero, another mindless crime 
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime 
“Hold the line, does anybody want to

B) INSIDE the HELICOPTER: FREDDIE closes his eyes, his 
hand protectively massaging his THROAT, clearly in 
discomfort. 
ANGLE ON: MARY & JIM HUTTON looking at FREDDIE, concerned. 
FREDDIE (V.O.) 
“The show must go on, 
The show must go on...

As the BAND gets ready...a DOCTOR prepares a HUGE NEEDLE, 
seriously HUGE, and goes to FREDDIE with the SYRINGE - 
FREDDIE 
Where are you sticking that?! 
DOCTOR 
Back of your throat. Small steroid 
injection. 
FREDDIE 
Get that away from me! Christ! 
(to MARY) 
I need vodka and three cigarettes 
right-fucking-now! 
The DOCTOR looks at JIM BEACH, who shrugs, and accepts 
FREDDIE’s decision. As the DOCTOR exits...

Ahhh---hah!--hah!

How long do we have? 
BRIAN 
As long as you need then halve it. 
FREDDIE

Ahhh---hah!--hah! DAAYY-O--AAYYY-O...

Guys?! I have to cut the DAY-O’s with

Because you wash it six times a day. 
FREDDIE 
That makes no sense. 
JIM BEACH steps up, and holds out a CIGARETTE for FREDDIE 
to smoke from it as JIM holds it - but this is a new 
FREDDIE and, seated at his MIRROR, he takes the CIGARETTE - 
he will do it himself. 
FREDDIE 
Miami? I thank you. 
I’m turning over a new leaf. 
From now on I’m going monastic. 
MARY passes FREDDIE a glass of VODKA. 
FREDDIE 
Early nights, mineral water - 
(raises his vodka) 
Nastrovia. 
FREDDIE downs the VODKA, stands up, gargles it for a few 
seconds... 
FREDDIE looks at MARY, who angles her face to be kissed ON 
THE LIPS...but FREDDIE (significantly) KISSES HER ON THE 
FOREHEAD FOR SAFETY SAKE! (confirming he is HIV positive.) 
FREDDIE then continues his vocal warm ups, bouncing up and 
down on his feet - 
FREDDIE 
Come on voice come on voice come 
on voice--you can do it--one more 
charge--one last hurrarr... 
JIM HUTTON steps up and gives FREDDIE’s hair one last blast 
of HAIR-SPRAY, and then FREDDIE and JIM KISS each other ON 
THE LIPS for good luck...(the diagnosis of Aids comes too 
late to change anything for them.) 
FREDDIE 
AHH..HA,HA,HA, MEEE,MEEE... 
ROGER then comes and joins FREDDIE. Now they are both 
bouncing up and down on their feet...ROGER slaps FREDDIE’s 
butt, and FREDDIE slaps it back... Then JOHN joins them. 
Three of them now bouncing... 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
141.

ANGLE ON: BRIAN, watching, smiling, moved. He goes to join 
them. They link arms - brothers again - and bounce and 
vocally warm-up together. 
EXT. MIXING BOARD/ LIVE AID - DAY 
The QUEEN SOUNDMAN wearing a QUEEN T-SHIRT comes behind the 
MIXING BOARD, looking shifty... 
QUEEN SOUNDMAN 
Soundman for Queen. 
MIXER 
Hey man. 
QUEEN SOUNDMAN 
Just checking you’re all set. 
MIXER 
Yeah, it’s cool, we’re all good. 
EXT. BACKSTAGE/ LIVE AID - DAY 
FREDDIE leads the BAND past the other POP-STARS toward the 
stage, where there is a growing ROAR from the crowd. The 
other POP-STARS clap QUEEN on the backs, wishing them well. 
They are stopped, by the STAGE MANAGER, who is waiting for 
the CUE-CALL. The BAND are NERVOUS as hell, and it 
shows...they form a CIRCLE. No one speaks. Until - 
JOHN 
Probably not too late to cancel. 
They shoot JOHN a look, then laugh - tension broken. 
JOHN 
Jesus Christ. 
BRIAN 
What a terrible job this is. 
JOHN 
I’m finding another line of work. 
FREDDIE holds out his FIST. The band BUMP FISTS, as- 
STAGE-MANAGER 
(getting word) 
Okay. Let’s move to the wings. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
142.

FREDDIE walks to one WING (stage left) and the band walk to 
the other WING (stage right) and wait - 
CLOSE ON: FREDDIE, and then his POV (across the stage) of: 
his FRIENDS, his buddies - he is enormously proud of them 
in this moment. 
They look at each other, all NERVOUS. They nod to each 
other...ROGER, BRIAN, JOHN, FREDDIE. 
And then we hear the announcement of QUEEN - 
MEL SMITH (OS) 
Ladies And Gentlemen--give a great 
big Wembley and Round-The-World 
welcome--forrrrrrrr - 
As QUEEN start to move, we CUT THE SOUND-TRACK - TOTAL 
SILENCE, as - 
- QUEEN take the stage to a wildly gesturing (BUT 
SOUNDTRACK-MUTED) CROWD.... 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - SUNRISE 
OLDER BRIAN has his HEAD in his HAND, as if recalling a 
DISASTER...but then he raises his head and we see - 
- a small SMILE forming on his face. He is recalling, in 
fact, a time of TRIUMPH! 
EXT. MIXING BOARD/ LIVE AID - DAY 
In SLO-MO....When the MIXER turns his back, the QUEEN 
SOUNDMAN pulls off the TAPE limiting the VOLUME and pushes 
the VOLUME SLIDERS way up to TEN!... 
As he does so - 
EXT. STAGE/ LIVE AID - DAY 
- the CAMERA (an AERIAL/ F/X SHOT) swoops down from on 
high, (as the SOUND of the CROWD becomes audible at last, 
RISING in volume.) The CAMERA rushes toward WEMBLEY 
STADIUM, then flies into the stadium, then flies inches 
over the heads of the vast audience, gliding like an eagle, 
toward the stage where a MAN just now walks out onto centre 
stage - 
- FREDDIE MERCURY, rock-star. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
143.

SOUND of the crowd reaches full (HUGE) VOLUME now - as - 
- FREDDIE greets the crowd, then sits at his PIANO and 
starts to play...”BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.” 
The crowd go crazy, and when he starts to sing the crowd 
sing along with him and wave their hands... 
So begins the greatest live set that QUEEN, or anyone else, 
ever performed. 
CUT TO: 
MARY and JIM HUTTON watch from the wings, as we - 
CUT TO: 
- the end of “BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY”....FREDDIE grabs his 
ICONIC WAND (his half-mic stand and mic) and struts his 
stuff as the band kick into “RADIO GAGA.” 
He soon has the entire crowd participating in the famous 
HAND-CLAP chorus... 
INT. BACKSTAGE/ LIVE AID - DAY 
The other POP STARS backstage realise something unique is 
happening and the gravitate to the wings. 
BOB GELDOFF 
Jesus! 
EXT. STAGE/ LIVE AID - DAY 
FREDDIE is now finishing “GAGA”, the audience is going 
wild! 
He then involves the crowd: 
FREDDIE 
AAAYY-OOOO! 
CROWD 
AAAYY-OOOO! 
REACTION BRIAN: Admiration for Freddie. 
So begins FRED’s “DAY-O” DIALOGUE with the crowd...ending 
in - a virtuoso DAY-O climax, no hint now of the fragile 
voice of backstage - 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
144.

FREDDIE 
ALRIGHT!! 
This next song is only dedicated to 
beautiful people here tonight. 
(beat) 
That means all of you. 
QUEEN launch into the intro of “WE WILL ROCK YOU!”. With 
ROGER smashing the DRUM/CLAP intro “BOOM-BOOM-CHA”, FREDDIE 
prompts the crowds to join the STAMP/HAND-CLAP 
INTRO...”BOOM-BOOM-CHA”... 
CLOSE ON: PLASTIC CUPS of BEER and WATER (on top of the onstage 
PIANO, left by previous performers) as - the WATER 
and BEER JUMPS with every CONCUSSIVE BEAT of the collective 
DRUM-BEAT (as if the approach of a Jurassic giant!) - the 
sound is that HUGE. 
INT. THE BULSARA HOME / FELTHAM - DAY 
The BULSARA FAMILY DRUM and CLAP to the intro of “WE WILL 
ROCK YOU” as they watch, delighted, FREDDIE on TV, 
conducting 100,000 ecstatic people... 
INT. MAY HOUSE - DAY 
BRIAN’s FATHER, HAROLD, watches the event on the TV, 
admiringly... 
INT. GAY BAR/ LONDON - DAY 
PAUL PRENTER watches, somberly, the bar’s TV while the 
other GAY CLIENTELE all cheer on FREDDIE’s performance. 
INT. CBS BOSS’S OFFICE / NEW YORK - MORNING 
YETNIKOFF watches a TV, smoking a cigar, sharing an aside 
with FINANCIAL OFFICER - 
YETNIKOFF 
And for me he writes a fucken opera! 
EXT. LIVE AID/ WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY 
WIDE: HERO SHOT of the outside of the ENTIRE STADIUM...as 
DUST rises like smoke inside, caused by 100,000 people 
stamping their feet on dry dirt - BOOM-BOOM-CHA!... 
CONTINUED: 
145.

EXT. STREETS OF WEMBLEY - DAY 
PEDESTRIANS have frozen in their tracks, and stare skyward, 
able to hear the BOOM-BOOM-CHA in the very air, wondering 
where in hell it’s coming from... ANGLE ON: a STORE’s PLATE 
GLASS WINDOW, vibrating to the BOOM-BOOM-CHA!... 
EXT. CAR PARK/WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY 
2 DOZEN CAR ALARMS, (on the newest cars only) have gone 
off, activated by this crowd-made EARTH-TREMOR... 
INT. BACK GARDEN/ WEMBLEY HOUSE - DAY 
A CHAINED DOG, hearing the far-off BOOM-BOOM-CHA, strains 
against his chain and BARKS/HOWLS. 
EXT. STAGE/ LIVE AID - DAY 
With the fuse lit, BRIAN blows the entire thing sky-high by 
launching into the famous POWER CHORDS of the INTRO, 
accompanied by ROGER and JOHN. The effect is orgasmic - 
the crowd ROARS! 
FREDDIE, now at PIANO, comes in with the SOLO PIANO intro 
of “WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS” 
FREDDIE 
“I've paid my dues/Time after time. 
I've done my sentence/ But committed 
no crime. 
JOHN comes in on BASS - 
FREDDIE 
“And bad mistakes? I've made a few. 
I've had my - 
BRIAN, fuelled with ADDED EMOTION, kicks in -as does ROGER - 
FREDDIE 
“- share of sand kicked in my face 
But I've come through! 
We are the champions, my friends, 
And we'll keep on fighting 'til 
the end. 
We are the champions. 
We are the champions. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
146.

No time for losers 
'Cause we are the champions of 
the world. 
FREDDIE on solo piano again - singing, intimately now - 
with the AUDIENCE singing along with him - 
FREDDIE 
“I've taken my bows/ And my curtain 
calls/ You brought me fame and fortune 
and everything that goes with it 
I thank you all! 
The CROWD roar! 
FREDDIE 
“But it's been no bed of roses, 
No pleasure cruise/ I consider it a 
challenge before the whole human race/ 
And I ain't gonna lose! 
FREDDIE AND CROWD 
“We are the champions, my friends, 
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the 
end. 
We are the champions. 
We are the champions. 
No time for losers 
'Cause we are the champions of the 
worrrrrrrrlllllldddddd!!!!” 
On the thunderous climactic chord - FREDDIE closes his 
EYES, chin raised, as if in prayer, then lowers his head, 
and opens his eyes - SMILING, EMOTIONAL, MOVED... 
CUT TO BLACK: 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - MORNING 
OLDER BRIAN 
(emotional) 
Write what you want. You people 
always do. I need to sleep. 
(pointing an accusing 
finger) 
Just don’t call him “wicked” or 
“corrupt”! - 
(passionately) 
- he lived life! To the brim! - 
and perhaps - 
(softening) 
- yeah, over the brim - 
CONTINUED: 
FREDDIE (CONT'D) 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
147.

(forcefully again) 
- but he was always singing for the 
person right at the back of the 
stadium, the one who doesn’t fit in, 
the outcasts, the shy, and the prettydamn-
sure-they-don’t-matter. He showed 
them they too could fly, fly above the 
haters and the detractors and the 
pullers-down--coz that’s what rock and 
roll can do. It can re-define you. 
Dream heroic--and little Farrokh 
Bulsara did that. 
BLOGGER 
(nodding) 
“Re-define you.” In what way? 
OLDER BRIAN 
If you’ve never put on your favourite 
song and never felt it--then you’ll 
never know. 
(beat) 
Freddie made you feel--better--bigger-- 
braver... 
(smiles, gently) 
...happier. Now that’s it, we’re done! 
We’re done. 
BLOGGER 
But we didn’t get to the end! The 
end of the story. 
OLDER BRIAN 
You know what happened. Everyone 
knows what happened. 
BLOGGER 
Must have been very hard. 
BRIAN hands the BLOGGER back his TAPE-RECORDER that long 
since stopped recording. 
OLDER BRIAN 
You ran out of battery. Do you 
need a taxi? Let me call a cab. 
BLOGGER 
Were you there at the end? 
My last question. Promise. 
BRIAN crosses the ROOM to the FIRE-ESCAPE DOORS and throws 
them opens - NATURAL LIGHT FLOODS IN! Outside... 
SUNRISE... COUNTRY FIELDS...

OLDER BRIAN (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUED) 
148.

OLDER BRIAN 
Look at that! It’s morning! 
BLOGGER 
Dr May? 
OLDER BRIAN 
Mmmm? 
BLOGGER 
One last question. 
OLDER BRIAN 
You used your last question several 
hours ago. 
BLOGGER 
Bismillah. Bismillah. 
Will you ever tell anyone what 
Freddie meant by that word? 
BRIAN considers answering, then goes to his BOOK-CASE and 
takes out an enormous ATLAS. 
OLDER BRIAN 
Here. A gift. Now get out of here! 
Out! 
BRIAN now pushes the BLOGGER out of the room, and shuts the 
DOORS. He goes to a shelf and takes down a bottle of 
BOURBON... 
INT. BLOGGER’S PARKED CAR (2016) - MORNING 
The BLOGGER, opens BRIAN’s LARGE ATLAS (on the passenger 
seat) at the INDEX...looking for something... 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - MORNING 
BRIAN, on his SMART-PHONE, swipes through QUEEN ALBUM 
COVERS, and then selects “INNUENDO”. As he taps the screen 
we hear - (bluetoothed to a SPEAKER) FREDDIE’s voice, 
singing - “THESE ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES”... 
FREDDIE (V.O.) 
“Sometimes I get to feelin' 
I was back in the old days--long ago 
When we were kids, when we were young 
Things seemed so perfect - you know? 
The days were endless, we were crazy - 
we were young - 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
149.

As he listens, BRIAN, pours a BOURBON, and looks out the 
OPEN DOORS...into the garden and countryside... 
EXT. FREDDIE’S MANSION/ LONDON - MORNING 
CROWDS of FANS mourn FREDDIE’s death, leave gifts and 
flowers for FREDDIE, light votive candles...PHOTOS of 
FREDDIE and of QUEEN. Over this... 
FREDDIE 
“The sun was always shinin' - we just 
lived for fun. Sometimes it seems like 
lately - I just don't know, the rest 
of my life's been - just a show. 
Those were the days of our lives. The 
bad things in life were so few. Those 
days are all gone now but one thing is 
true - When I look and I find I still 
love you.” 
INT. BLOGGER’S PARKED CAR (2016) - MORNING 
The BLOGGER goes to the page he wants in the ATLAS, and 
then leans in, staring at the VERY LARGE PLATE...and then 
his EXPRESSION changes--he has seen something--exactly what 
he’s looking for... 
FREDDIE 
“You can't turn back the clock, 
you can't turn back the tide 
Ain't that a shame?...” 
EXT. BACK-STREETS/ ZANZIBAR - DAY 
A BUCK-TOOTHED TEN-YEAR-OLD INDIAN BOY, FARROKH BULSARA, in 
sandals and shorts and short-sleeved shirt, runs and plays 
in the alleys, full of simple joy, in the springtime of his 
life, his whole life before him... 
FREDDIE (V.O.) 
“I'd like to go back one time on a 
roller coaster ride 
When life was just a game 
No use sitting and thinkin' on what 
you did/ When you can lay back and 
enjoy it through your kids 
Sometimes it seems like lately I just 
don't know/ Better sit back and go - 
with the flow...

INT. BLOGGER’S PARKED CAR (2016) - MORNING 
CLOSE ON: A PLATE in the LARGE ATLAS...CAMERA shows 
“ZANZIBAR” and then moves and tightens on a small town... 
... ”BISMILLAH” 
FREDDIE (V.O.) 
“Cos these are the days of our lives 
They've flown in the swiftness of time 
These days are all gone now but some 
things remain 
When I look and I find - no change.” 
EXT. SHIP - DAY 
Young FARROKH BULSARA, stands alone at a RAIL on the deck 
of a SHIP, as it enters LIVERPOOL - a MIGRANT arriving in a

The bad things in life were so few 
Those days are all gone now but one 
thing's still true

I still love you.
