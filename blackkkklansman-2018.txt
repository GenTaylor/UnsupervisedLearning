Superimposed: 1972
An amazing contrast. The beautiful landscape of Colorado
Springs, the City sits nestled within the rugged Mountain
terrain. The majestic Pikes Peak, the jagged beauty of The
Garden of the Gods, The plush Broadmoor Resort, The Will
Rodgers Shrine of The Sun.
RON STALLWORTH (V.O.)
Before I moved to Colorado Springs,
I never thought much about all these
Racial, Political things...I was
asleep...

INT. COLORADO SPRINGS CITY OFFICES - DAY

Ron stares at an Ad attached to a bulletin board.
CLOSE. THE AD READS:
JOIN THE COLORADO SPRINGS POLICE FORCE, MINORITIES ENCOURAGED
TO APPLY! Ron rips the Ad from the board.

INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - COLORADO SPRINGS POLICE DEPT - DAY
A drab, white-walled office. Ron sits across the table from
The Assistant Chief of Personnel, MR. WOODS, Black, 40's,
business like but progressive and CHIEF TAGGERT, White,
smart, 50's, in a Police Uniform, a Man ready for change.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Would you call yourself a Womanizer?

5.
RON STALLWORTH
No Sir, I would not.
MR. WOODS
Do you frequent Night Clubs?
No Sir.

RON STALLWORTH

CHIEF TAGGERT
Do you drink?
RON STALLWORTH
On Special occasions, Sir.
MR. WOODS
Have you ever done any Drugs?
RON STALLWORTH
Only those prescribed by My Doctor,
Sir.
Woods looks at The Chief.
MR. WOODS
That's kind of rare these days for a
young Hip Guy like you.
RON STALLWORTH
I know but my Father was in The
Military and I was raised up that
way, Sir.
CHIEF TAGGERT
How are you with people, generally?
RON STALLWORTH
Sir, they treat me right, I treat
them right, like I already said I was
raised...
CHIEF TAGGERT
...Have you ever had any negative...
Mr. Woods jumps in, impatient.
MR. WOODS
...What would you do if another Cop
called you a Nigger?
Ron goes silent. Chief Taggert looks at him. Woods waits, Ron
doesn't know how to respond, finally. Woods leans forward.

6.
MR. WOODS (CONT'D)
There's never been a Black Cop in
this City. If we make you an Officer,
you would, in effect, be the Jackie
Robinson of the Colorado Springs
Police force.
Mr. Woods lets this sink in.
MR. WOODS (CONT'D)
And if you know anything about Jackie
Robinson you know he had to take a
lot of... guff... from his fellow
Teammates, from Fans, other Teams,
and The Press.
RON STALLWORTH
I know Jackie's Story, Sir.
MR. WOODS
Good. So, knowing that, when someone
calls you Nigger will you be able to
turn the other Cheek?
Ron evaluates the hard reality of the question. Decides.
RON STALLWORTH
If I need to, yes, Sir.
MR. WOODS
Good. We think you might be The Man
to open things up here. Chief Taggert
here will be your Branch Rickey.
Ron looks at Chief Taggert.
CHIEF TAGGERT
I'll have your back but I can only do
so much. The Weight of this is on
You...and You alone.
Ron weighs The Journey ahead.

Ron in full Uniform walks The Beat. The Cap fits but creates
Afro Puffs with his Hair which was the style back then. White
Citizens pass him on the street smiling, some surprised, some
leery of the sight. Ron nods, smiles to everyone.

INT. RECORDS ROOM - CSPD - DAY
Ron sorts a file cabinet of records as OFFICER CLOUGHERTY,
60's, White, sits on a stool, reading a Magazine clearly
looking at a Photo of something good.
Ron...

OFFICER CLOUGHERTY

Ron looks up from the filing. Officer Clougherty holds the
Magazine up and shows a Photo to Ron.
OFFICER CLOUGHERTY (CONT'D)
Whatdoyouthink?
Ron looks at the Photo of the Actress Faye Dunaway.
RON STALLWORTH
Faye Dunaway. She was great in Bonnie
and Clyde.
OFFICER CLOUGHERTY
Yeah, but ah, what you think?
RON STALLWORTH
She's a very good Actress.
OFFICER CLOUGHERTY
Y'know you want some of that.
Ron ignores it.
OFFICER CLOUGHERTY (CONT'D)
Truth be told when I see one of your
kind with a White Woman it turns my
Stomach.
RON STALLWORTH
Yeah. Why's that?
OFFICER CLOUGHERTY
He could only want one thing.
RON STALLWORTH
What would that be?
OFFICER CLOUGHERTY
You like acting dumb, Y'know.
RON STALLWORTH
No, I just like my questions to be
answered.
A VOICE of a UNIFORMED COP WHEATON calls from the other side
of the Counter.

WHEATON (O.S.)
Hey! Anybody in there? Looking for a
Toad here.
Ron walks to the Counter to see The White and sleep-deprived
Cop impatiently leaning on his elbows.
WHEATON
Get me the record for this Toad named
Raymond Jackson.
Ron pulls up the File for Raymond Jackson. The Photo shows a
Black Man in his twenties.
WHEATON
While you're at it, why don't you
grab another Toad... Steven Wilson.
Ron pulls the File... another young Black Male, ANOTHER
SEXUAL PREDATOR.

INT. CSPD HALLWAY - DAY

Chief Taggert strides down the hall with SGT. TRAPP a softspoken White Man in his 40's, they are discussing a File. Ron
suddenly appears walking with them.
RON STALLWORTH
While I've got you both here. Sirs,
I'd like to be an Undercover
Detective.
Chief Taggert and Sgt. Trapp both stop.
CHIEF TAGGERT
What Narcotics?
RON STALLWORTH
Whatever Department works, Sir.
SGT. TRAPP
You just joined The Force, Son.
RON STALLWORTH
I know, Sir but I think I could do
some good there.
How so?

SGT. TRAPP

RON STALLWORTH
Well, I'm young. I think there's a
niche for me. Get In where I can Fit
In.

9.
SGT. TRAPP
What do you think, Chief?
Sgt. Trapp sees the logic, looks to Chief Taggert, who stops,
considering.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Think a lot of yourself, don't cha?
RON STALLWORTH
Just trying to be of help, Sir.
RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
Plus, I hate working in The Records
room.
Sgt. Trapp reacts knowing Ron shouldn't have said that about
the Records Room. CHIEF TAGGERT looks at Ron, matter of fact.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Well, I think Records is a good place
for you to start.
Chief Taggert walks off without another word. SGT. TRAPP
gives a knowing look to Ron, who watches them walk away.

INT. RECORDS ROOM - CSPD - DAY
Ron behind the Counter. A SERGEANT MORRIS, White, Mid-30's, a
regular guy but there is something dangerous there, steps up.
SGT. MORRIS
Need a File on a Toad.
Ron doesn't respond.
SGT. MORRIS (CONT'D)
You Deaf? I said I need info on a
Toad.
RON STALLWORTH
No Toads here.
Excuse me?

SGT. MORRIS

RON STALLWORTH
I said, I don't have any Toads. I do
have Human Beings and if you give me
their names I can pull the Files.
Sgt. Morris scowls. Ron stares back at him, Eye to Eye.

10.
SGT. MORRIS
Heard you think you Hot Shit but you
ain't nuthin' but a Cold Fart. Name's
Maurice, Maurice Smalls...That
respectful enough for you, Officer
Toad.
Ron pulls The File, throws it down on the Counter. As Sgt.
Morris takes The File, Ron puts his hand on it, stopping him.
RON STALLWORTH
Let me tell you something Sergeant.
The day of the Toads in The Records
Room is over. You want to find a
Toad... go look in the water out at
Rainbow Falls. They got them there.
Sgt. Morris snatches The File from the Counter and storms
off. A Bad Ass Ron watches him go.
RON STALLWORTH (V.O.)
In reality, I didn't say anything.
CUT TO:
Here is THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE. Sgt. Morris gives a cocky sneer
to Ron and SNATCHES the Folder from him.
RON STALLWORTH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
I did it the Jackie Robinson Way and
swallowed Racial Justice for The
Bigger goal of keeping The Peace and
moving The Baserunner around The
Bases... but I wanted to lay his Ass
out but I pushed my anger down, kept
it to myself.
The Sergeant struts away. Ron watches shaking inside with
Rage.
RON STALLWORTH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
It's No wonder Jackie died at Age 53,
hair White as Snow. God Bless His
Soul.

INT. RON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING
As Ron sleeps, a phone rings. Ron snaps awake and grabs at
the phone on the night table.
Hello.

RON STALLWORTH

CHIEF TAGGERT (O.S.)
It's Taggert. You sleeping?

10

11.
RON STALLWORTH
Yes, Chief, I was. Just worked a
Night Shift.
CHIEF TAGGERT (O.S.)
I changed my mind, you're gonna come
in a little earlier today. We've got
an assignment for you. 12 Noon.
Sharp. Narcotics Division. Wear
Street clothes.
RON STALLWORTH
Yes Sir, see you then. Thank You.
Thank You.
Ron sits up in Bed, excited, thinking about the challenge
ahead.

Ron, dressed in Bell-Bottoms and a Hip Italian Knit Shirt,
Marshmallow Shoes steps inside the Narcotics office, which is
literally The Basement of The Station. He looks around at The

however is somewhat of a closed-off guy, all business, Ron
sits across from him. Chief Taggert steps before them.
CHIEF TAGGERT (CONT'D)
We've got limited time so I'll be
quick. That Black Radical Stokely
Carmichael is giving a Speech Tonight
at Bell's Nightingale.
Ron is surprised at this.

12.
RON STALLWORTH
The Nightclub?
CHIEF TAGGERT
The only Black Nightclub in Town.
Chuck just listens.
CHIEF TAGGERT (CONT'D)
Carmichael is a former High MuckityMuck with The Black Panthers and as
far as I'm concerned, FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover was dead right when he
said The Black Panthers is The
Greatest Internal Threat to The
Security of these United States. This
Carmichael Guy, former Panther or
not, they say he's a Damn Good
Speaker and we don't want this
Carmichael getting into The Minds of
our Good Negroes stirred up here in
Colorado Springs.
Ron's face cringes at Chief Taggert's words. He steps to Ron.
CHIEF TAGGERT (CONT'D)
Ron, your assignment is to go to this
Rally tonight and infiltrate these
Bunch of Subversive's and monitor The
Audience reaction to Carmichael's
speech. You ready?
Chuck and Chief Taggert stare at Ron.
Born Ready.

INT. NARCOTICS DIVISION - CSPD - NIGHT
Ron stands, his shirt off, as Chuck wires a Wireless
Transmitter and Microphone to his body. Another Narcotics
Cop, JIMMY ROSE, 30's, observe the instillation.
RON STALLWORTH
Any chance this thing Fucks Up?
JIMMY
A good chance.
Then what?

RON STALLWORTH

CHUCK
Just stick to The Game Plan.

12

13.

Which is?

RON STALLWORTH

CHUCK
Improvise. Like Jazz. This isn't some
Big Bust. We just want some Intel,
that's it.
JIMMY
What happens if someone offers you a
Marijuana Cigarette?
RON STALLWORTH
You mean a Joint?
Yeah.

JIMMY

RON STALLWORTH
"Soul Brother, I'm already High on
Life. Can you Dig It?"
JIMMY
And if someone pulls a Gun on you?
Ron is caught off guard.
RON STALLWORTH
You expecting that?
Jimmy pulls his Gun points it in Ron's face.
JIMMY
Barrel of a 45's in your face, Finger
on the Trigger, now what?
Chuck sighs.
RON STALLWORTH
Blood, get that Gun out my face.
Peace Love and Soul.
Jimmy still holds it there.
Drop it.

CHUCK

He lowers gun. Ron gives Jimmy a wary look speaking to Chuck.
RON STALLWORTH
I de-escalate. Talk calmly, firmly.
Find a way out of there, A-Sap.
Jimmy nods, satisfied. Chuck is finished with The Wiring. Ron
takes a deep breath.

14.
CHUCK
Relax, we'll be outside, listening
in.
RON STALLWORTH
Can I order a Drink at The Bar?
Chuck steps away, no comment.
JIMMY
That's fine, just don't get Shit
Face.
Got it?

CHUCK

RON STALLWORTH
I got it. I'm gone.
Jimmy laughs, Slaps Ron on the back.

EXT. CITY STREET - OUTSKIRTS OF DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

Ron pulls an unmarked Sedan to the curb. He gets out and
looks around.
A Crowded sidewalk overflows into The Street, filling a line
that Bottlenecks into The Club with the Sign:
CLOSE SIGN - BELL'S NIGHTINGALE
ANGLE - TONIGHT: KWAME TURE SPEAKS
Ron walks to the back of the line. He becomes an Every
Brother slowly moving forward as People enter. As he moves
forward he notice a striking Woman at the Front Door.
PATRICE DUMAS
Mid 20's, an Angela Davis Afro, she wears a Hip array of
Militant wear, Black Leather Jacket, Love Beads but on her it
looks fantastic. Ron is taken by her Beauty, he watches as
she monitors the door, clearly in charge.
RON STALLWORTH
How are you doing, my Queen?
Patrice gives Ron a good look summing him up.
PATRICE
I'm doing fine, my Soldier. This is
going to be an Amazing Night.
RON STALLWORTH
Indeed it is.

PATRICE
Have you heard Brother Kwame speak
before?
Who?
Kwame Ture.

RON STALLWORTH
PATRICE

RON STALLWORTH
Actually, I haven't, I didn't know he
changed his name.
PATRICE
Yes, after he moved to Africa. He
took the names of Kwame Nkrumahm of
Ghana and his Mentor Sekou Toure of
Guinea to honor The Great Leaders.
RON STALLWORTH
That's Heavy. I can dig that. Do you
know how he got to Colorado Springs?
PATRICE
The Colorado College Black Student
Union brought him in.
RON STALLWORTH
You ah, you with Black Student Union.
PATRICE
I'm The President.
RON STALLWORTH
Right On. Right On.

INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT

The Club is PACKED, a Sea of Black Faces punctuated by an
occasional White Face. Ron moves through The Crowd. He avoids
direct Eye Contact, trying like Hell to act casual.
Ron steps to The Bar and signals The BARTENDER JABBO, 60's,
Black.
RON STALLWORTH
Rum and Coke with Lime.
As Jabbo makes his Drink, something catches Ron's Eye.
Patrice exits a door with several Black Bodyguard's.
Ron observes as a Tall figure exits with Patrice as they near
The Stage. The Tall figure hangs back covered by The
Bodyguards.

16.
Ron on his feet, Black Fist in the air with The Crowd.
Patrice on Stage with Kwame Ture with her Fist raised too.
The Shouting and Chanting finally cease, as Patrice speaks.
PATRICE
The Black Student Union of Colorado
College is honored to bring The
Vanguard of Revolutionaries fighting
for The Rights of Black People all
over The World. Let's show some Black
Love to The One and Only, The Former
Prime Minister of The Black Panther
Party, The Brother Man with The Plan
who's giving it to the Man, put your
Hands together my People... for Our
Kwame Ture.
PANDEMONIUM! As Kwame Ture walks onto a small raised stage
with Patrice. The entire place rises to their Feet, Fists
Raised, Clapping, Shouting "Ungawa Black Power!" Ron watches
as Patrice and Kwame hug. Patrice then leaves the Stage.
Kwame soaks in the Crowd's reaction, until...
KWAME TURE
Thank you all for coming out tonight,
My Beloved Sista's and Brotha's. I
Thank you...
CLOSE - KWAME TURE
towering at Six Feet-Four with an infectious smile and
Flawless Dark Skin, he's oozing Charisma out of every pore.
He stands behind a small podium.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
...I'm here to tell you this evening
it is time for you to stop running
away from being Black. You are
College Students, you should think.
It is time for you to understand that
you as The growing Intellectuals, The
Black Intellectuals of this Country,
you must define Beauty for Black
People.
The Black Students in The Audience are laser focused on him.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
Beauty is defined by someone with a
Narrow Nose, Thin Lips, White Skin.
You ain't got none of that. If your
Lips are Thick, Bite them in. Hold
your Nose! Don't drink Coffee because
it makes you Black!

17.
The Audience laughs! Loving it.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
Your Nose is Boss, your Lips are
Thick, you are Black and you are
Beautiful!
Everyone cheers including Ron!
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
We want to be like The White people
that oppress us in this Country and
since they hate us, we hate
ourselves. You dig Tarzan? I remember
that when I was a Boy I used to go
see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays. White
Tarzan used to Beat up The Black
Natives. I would sit there yelling
"Kill The Beasts, Kill The Savages,
Kill 'Em!" Actually I was saying:
"Kill Me." It was as if a Jewish Boy
watched Nazis taking Jews off to
Concentration Camps and cheered them
on. Today, I want The Chief to beat
The Hell out of Tarzan and send him
back to Europe. But it takes time to
become Free of The Lies and their
shaming effect on Black Minds. It
takes time to reject the most
Important Lie: that Black People
inherently can't do the same things
White People can do unless White
People help them.
The Audience laughing, overwhelmed, shouting back support! A
ROAR from The Crowd. Ron finds himself clapping along.
RON STALLWORTH
Right on!!! Right On!!!
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
The White West are the most Violent
People on The Face of The Earth. They
have used Violence to get everything
they have. And yet, they're the First
to talk about Violence. I never get
caught up with Violence. As a matter
of fact, one of my Favorite Quotes
that stops all the talk about it is
from Sartre: "What then did you
expect when you unbound The Gag that
muted The Black Mouth? That they
would chant your praises?

18.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
Did you think that when those Heads
that our Fathers had forcefully bowed
down to the ground were raised again,
you would find adoration in their
eyes?" That's Jean-Paul Sartre, not
me.
Ron looks around at everyone caught up in Kwame's spell.

KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
If a White Man wants to Lynch Me,
that's his Problem. If he's got The
Power to Lynch Me, that's My Problem.
Racism is not a question of Attitude;
it's a question of Power.
Ron is struck by the remark.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
It is White Power that makes The Laws
and it is Violent White Power in the
form of armed White Cops that
enforces their Laws with Guns and
Nightsticks. The vast majority of
Negroes in this Country live in
Captive Communities and must endure
their conditions of Oppression
because and only because they are
Black and Powerless. Now We are being
shot down like Dogs in the streets by
White Racist Policemen. We can no
longer accept this Oppression without
retribution. The War in Vietnam is
Illegal and Immoral. I'd rather see a
Brother Kill a Cop than Kill a
Vietnamese. At least he's got a
reason for Killing The Cop. When you
Kill a Vietnamese you're a Hero and
you don't even know why you Killed
him. At least if you Kill a Cop
you're doing it for a reason.
Another Applause Break. Ron listens, challenged, torn.

INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
Kwame holds The Crowd in The Palm of his Hand. They stand
rapt as he reaches his rousing Finale.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
We are on The Move for Our
Liberation.

15

19.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
We're tired of trying to prove things
To White People. We're tired of
trying to explain to White People
that we're not going to hurt them. We
are concerned with getting things We
want. The thing we have to have to
function. The question is, Will White
People overcome their Racism and
allow for that to happen in this
Country? If not, We have no choice
but to say very clearly, "Move on
over or We're going to move over
you," sure as the Night follows day.
Members of the Audience who were sitting already are rising
to their Feet...

KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
Let me remind you of a Poem By Prime
Minister Winston Churchill read when
England was getting ready to Attack
Germany. It Was written by a Black
Man named Claude McKay from Jamaica
and He wrote it for Black People. It
is called "IF WE MUST DIE". It is our
Poem Today in The United States. "If
We must Die, let it not be like Hogs
Hunted and Penned in an Inglorious
Spot While round us Bark The Mad
Hungry Dogs Makin Their Mock at Our
Accursed Lot. If We must Die, O let
Us Nobly Die, So that Our Precious
Blood may not be Shed In Vain; then
even The Monsters We Defy Shall be
constrained to Honor us though Dead O
Kinsmen!!! We Must meet The Common
Foe!!! Though Far Outnumbered Let Us
Show Us Brave And for their Thousand
Blows deal One Deathblow! What though
before us lies The Open Grave? Like
Men we'll face The Murderous,
Cowardly Pack Pressed to The Wall,
dying, but Fighting Back!"
The Black Crowd Cheers.

20.
KWAME TURE (CONT'D)
That's Brother Claude McKay, not me.
In closing I know it's getting late,
may I leave you Sista's and Brothers
with these Last Words. "If I am not
for myself, who will be? If I am for
myself alone, who am I? If not now,
when? And if not you, who?" We need
an Undying Love for Black People
wherever We may be. Good Night and
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, POWER TO THE
PEOPLE.
The BLACK MASS STANDS AS ONE WITH KWAME TURE.
KWAME TURE AND BLACK MASS

Ron moves down the Greeting Line for Kwame. He watches as
Patrice stands near him. Kwame pulls her in close, whispers
something in her ear. She smiles, a bit smitten.
Ron watches as he finally reaches Kwame, shaking his hand.
RON STALLWORTH
Brother Ture, do you really think a
War between The Black and White Race
is inevitable?
Kwame pulls Ron in close toward his face. Too close.

Drink?
PATRICE
I'm waiting for Kwame, I have to make
sure he gets back safely to the Hotel
and he's squared away.
RON STALLWORTH
I can dig it.
Ron starts to walk away.
PATRICE
Maybe, if it's not too late, I'll
meet you at The Red Lantern. You know
where that is?
I do.

RON STALLWORTH

PATRICE
So I'll see you then.

Ron sits at The Bar waiting for Patrice. He looks at his
watch having been there a while. He finishes his Rum and
Coke with Lime watching the door open but it is not Patrice.
He decides to call it a Night, stepping off his stool, paying
his Tab to BRO POPE, The Bartender when...
PATRICE
Sorry I'm late...
Patrice is right there near him. She flops down on the Bar
stool, exhausted.
PATRICE (CONT'D)
My sincere apologies, you won't
believe what happened.

22.
Patrice says to Bro Pope, The Bartender.
PATRICE (CONT'D)
Bro Pope, Seven and Seven, please...
The Pigs pulled us over.
Say what?

RON STALLWORTH

PATRICE
Yeah, they knew Kwame was in Town.
Made us get out the Car. Pigs pulled
us over for no reason. Total

PATRICE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
Yeah, we were guilty of being Black
while driving in America!!!
SGT. MORRIS
All right everybody out the vehicle.

Kwame, Patrice and Two other Black Colorado College Students,
HAKIM and LEON, both Black 20's, climb out of the vehicle.
Sgt. Morris pushes Kwame against the Car.
SGT. MORRIS(CONT'D)
I don't wanna see nuthin' but Black
Asses and Black Elbows. Spread 'em!!!
Kwame, Patrice, Hakim and Leon are all Spread Eagle against

He takes Extra Time patting down Patrice getting in some
"Groping" in for Good Measure.

Wesson and Smith enter Patrice's Car, searching it. Sgt.
Morris turns Kwame around, facing him.
OFFICER MORRIS (CONT'D)
You that so called Big Shot Panther
Nigger aren't you. Heard you was in
Town.
KWAME TURE
My Name is Kwame Ture... Are We
Guilty of "Drivin' While
Black"?...PIG!!!
Sgt. Morris stares him down for a moment. You think he's
gonna slug him but he thinks better. The other Cops go
through the Car searching, throwing things around.
OFFICER MORRIS
I know you Black Bastards are
holding. What you got in there some
Weed, Pills, Heroin?
Patrice, Kwame and the others just stare back, silent.
It's clean.

Bro Pope, The Bartender sets the Drink down. Patrice takes a
Drink, her hand shaking. Ron observes.

CHIEF TAGGERT
What was the Room like?
RON STALLWORTH
Folks were hanging on every word.
CHIEF TAGGERT
He had them pretty riled up?
RON STALLWORTH
But I'm not sure that means Black
Folks were ready to start a Riot.
CHIEF TAGGERT
What makes you think that?
RON STALLWORTH
Nobody was talking about that. That
wasn't the Mood. Everybody was Cool.
CHIEF TAGGERT
He told a Crowd of "Black Folks" to
get ready for a Race War. That they
were going to have to arm themselves.
What about that?
RON STALLWORTH
Yeah, he said that but I think that
was just talk. You know, Rhetoric.
CHUCK (O.S.)
That's what I thought too.
Ron looks over at Chuck taking the Reel off The Reel to Reel.
CHIEF TAGGERT

Sure.

CHIEF TAGGERT

Chief Taggert starts to leave the room. Ron decides to say
it.
RON STALLWORTH
Did you hear the Story Patrice told
me about how the CSPD pulled over her
and Ture?
Chief Taggert stops, drinks in the question. Everything goes
silent. He then gives Ron a deliberate look.
CHIEF TAGGERT
No. We didn't hear that.
From Chief Taggert's look, Ron knows he did. Jimmy, Chuck
stare at Ron. A Big White Elephant in the room.
CHIEF TAGGERT (CONT'D)
Patrice. She's the one from The Black
Student Union? They brought Too-Ray
in.
RON STALLWORTH
Kwame Ture, Correct.
CHIEF TAGGERT
You got pretty Chummy with her?
If Ron pushes it more he know it will go bad. He drops it.
RON STALLWORTH
Just doing my job, Chief. Undercover.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Yeah and it better not be Under the
Cover Of The Sheets.
RON STALLWORTH
I would never jeopardize a Case...
CHIEF TAGGERT
...Prepare an In-Depth Report and

Young People Madder than Hell.

27.
RON STALLWORTH (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Ron looks around. Shrugs. Might as well do it...
RON STALLWORTH
I Hate Niggers, Jews, Mexicans,
Spics, Chinks but especially Niggers
and anyone else that does not have
pure White Aryan Blood running
through their Veins.
All Heads in the Unit turn toward Ron.
RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
In fact, my Sister was recently
accosted by a Nigger...
Ron is snarling now, every ounce of his Voice projecting
White Supremacist Hate. He is utterly convincing.
RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
...Every time I think about that
Black Baboon putting his Filthy Black
Hands on her White as Pure Driven
Snow Body I wanna Puke!!!
Silence on the other end of The Line.
DEEP THROAT (O.S.)
You're just the kind of Guy we're
looking for. When can we meet?
Chuck, Jimmy and all the other White Undercover Cops are
Rolling their Eyes. Stepping away, shaking their heads. Some
wanting to laugh but DON'T.
RON STALLWORTH
How about Friday night? After I get
off work?
The other Cops are losing their minds, Quietly.
DEEP THROAT (O.S.)
Fantastic! I'll get back to you with
details. Take care, Buddy Boy.
RON STALLWORTH
Looking forward to meeting you.
Ron looks around. Everyone in the Unit is standing around his

Well... they want to meet me First.
SGT. TRAPP
They want to meet you.
RON STALLWORTH
I'll need another Undercover to go in
my place.
SGT. TRAPP
Yeah... you probably shouldn't go to
that meeting.
You think?

RON STALLWORTH

Everyone has a Chuckle.

A spacious office, its walls brimming with Books. Chief

This is a first for me.
Ron and Sgt. Trapp sit opposite the desk.
Chief Taggert thinks a moment.

CHIEF TAGGERT (CONT'D)
When is this meeting?
48 hours.

SGT. TRAPP

CHIEF TAGGERT
I can't spare any Men.
SGT. TRAPP
I've looked over your Logs and it
seems you can spare them.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Sgt. Trapp, Ron spoke to the Man on
the phone. When they hear the Voice
of one of my Guys, they'll know the
difference.
RON STALLWORTH
Why so, Chief?
CHIEF TAGGERT
Want me to spell it out? He'll know
the difference between how a White
Man talks and a Negro.
RON STALLWORTH
What does a Black Man talk like?
Silence.
SGT. TRAPP
Ron, I think what The Chief is trying
to say is...
RON STALLWORTH
...If you don't mind, I'd like to
talk for myself. How exactly does a
Black Man talk?
CHIEF TAGGERT
You know... YOU KNOW!!!
RON STALLWORTH
Chief, some of us can speak King's
English and Jive. I happen to be
fluent in both.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Ron, how do you propose to make this
investigation?

32.
RON STALLWORTH
I have established contact and
created some familiarity with The
Klansmen over the phone. I will
continue that role but another
Officer, a White Officer, will play
Me when they meet Face to Face. In
essence, there will be Two Ron
Stallworth's, a Black One and a White
One. Of course the challenge is to
convince The Klan at all times they
are dealing with only ONE Ron
Stallworth...THE WHITE RON
STALLWORTH!!!...
CHIEF TAGGERT
...My Point Exactly!!!...
Ron continues talking to Chief Taggert.
RON STALLWORTH
...This other Officer and I will need
to work very closely together. We'll
need to know ever aspect of each
other's dealings with The KKK. Black
Ron Stallworth on The phone and White
Ron Stallworth Face to Face. Every
detail will be critical. We'll have
to create a Flow between us so we
never drop a Beat. So there becomes a
combined Ron Stallworth.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Can you do that?
RON STALLWORTH
I believe we can... With The Right
White Man.

Can't believe I'm doing this. Hey,
Jimmy when's the last time they let a
rookie head up an investigation. Oh

Ron holds his tongue. Jimmy is finished taping him up.
JIMMY
The Mic has been cutting in and out
lately, so watch that.
Ron sidles up to Chuck, plops a Trucker Hat on him. Chuck
turns to Ron outfit on display.
CHUCK

RON STALLWORTH
Remember you've got to retain the
details of what you share with them
so I can be White Ron Stallworth.
CHUCK
Jimmy, I always wanted to grow up to
be Black. As a Kid all my Heroes were
Black Guys. Willie Mays, Wilt The
Stilt but my favorite is O.J.
JIMMY
Love Fuckin' O.J.
RON STALLWORTH
Well, don't share your Love of The
Brothers with these Guys. It's
strictly Ajax White Knight Love of
White Folks.
CHUCK
I get to play you but you don't get
to play me. Jimmy, I'd get a kick
outta seeing somebody playing me.
RON STALLWORTH
Oh, I get to play you and Jimmy and
all the other guys in the Station...

Chuck doesn't understand, he looks at Jimmy. Both befuddled.

into The Chamber and pulls the action forward.
Ready to go.

off again. The next button would mean The End. CURTAINS.
He quickly buttons it. Then...
KEN
Say, Ron? Mind coming with me?
Where to?

CHUCK

BUTCH
You Undercover or something? You ask
too many questions. Let's GO!!!
Behind Ken, Butch is Laser-Focused on Chuck's every move.

KEN
Congrats you passed The Mustard.
Ken exchanges uneasy looks with Butch.
KEN (CONT'D)
Thought we'd get the Membership

Chuck can breathe again.
CHUCK
Now we're talkin'.
Ken hands Chuck a stack of papers.
KEN
Fill these out and Mail 'em to The
National Headquarters. Once they send
your Membership Card, you'll be able
to participate in our Programs.
Chuck sings The Alcoa Jingle.
CHUCK
Alcoa Can't wait.
DUANE
I like that Commercial.
KEN
Membership Fees: Ten Dollars for The

Robes and Hood not included, that's
Extra.
BUTCH
Fuckin' Inflation.
Chuck shakes hands with all.
CHUCK
I can't thank you Brothers enough.
KEN
Pleasure, is all ours.
Butch and Duane give polite nods.
KEN (CONT'D)
I'll take you back to your Car.
As Chuck turns to leave...

BUTCH
You're not a Jew, right?
Chuck stops.
CHUCK
You trying to offend me?
Chuck turns to Ken: you believe this Shit?
BUTCH
It's Protocol.
All eyes on Chuck. His face flares with rage.
CHUCK
'Course I'm no Stinkin' Kike.
KEN

Duane nods. Butch just stares.
BUTCH
Smells good to me.

INT. INTELLIGENCE UNIT - CSPD - NIGHT
Ron helps Chuck rip The Wire off his Chest.
CHUCK
You have me dressed like one of
the Beverly Hillbillies for
Chrissakes. I felt too Redneck for
those Guys.
RON STALLWORTH
They liked you.
CHUCK
Except for that Butch guy. And didja
have to ride his Bumper like that?
RON STALLWORTH
You got The Papers. They want you to
join.
CHUCK
Technically they want you to join.
RON STALLWORTH
They want a Black Man to join The Ku
Klux Klan. I'd call that Mission
Impossible Double Success.

55

Sergeant Trapp sits at his desk, thumbing through The Report.
Ron and Chuck stand across from him.
SGT. TRAPP
And exactly how much should we be
worrying about them?
RON STALLWORTH
Enough that we'd like to dig deeper.
One of the Men discussed plans for a
possible Attack...
CHUCK
...I wouldn't give him that much
credit. These Yahoos like to Boast.
SGT. TRAPP
What kind of Attack?
Ron looks to Chuck.
CHUCK
Duane said "BOOM", mentioned
something about Fireworks.
Personally, I didn't buy it. Doubt
they're even capable.
Trapp bridges his hands together, contemplating.
RON STALLWORTH
Either way, we're looking for full
support from The Department.
SGT. TRAPP
Taggert might not be happy his Star
Narc is gonna be stuck on this Case.
Ron just stares at Trapp.

Jacket.

PATRICE
Most Brothers would give up after the
first time they unsuccessfully asked
me out.
RON STALLWORTH
I didn't have a good shot the first
time. You were pretty taken with
Kwame.
They both have to laugh. Patrice thinks back on it.
PATRICE (CONT'D)
The next day when we dropped him off
at the Airport he told me the
Movement needed Strong Sistah's like
me to lead the fight against
Capitalist oppression and The
Politicians and Pigs who perpetuate
it. His words almost made that whole
nightmare worth while...
Ron goes Mute.
PATRICE (CONT'D)
...What's wrong?
RON STALLWORTH
I don't really use that word.
What word?
Pigs.

PATRICE
RON STALLWORTH

PATRICE
What else would you call them?
RON STALLWORTH
Cops... Police...
PATRICE
Bunch of Racist Cops on a Power Trip.
RON STALLWORTH
So you think all Cops are Racist!!!
PATRICE
It only takes One to pull a Trigger
on a Innocent Brother.
RON STALLWORTH
I can't argue with that.

47.
Patrice absorbs all of this.
PATRICE
Why were you at Brother Kwame's
Speech?
RON STALLWORTH
He's got some good ideas. I don't
agree with all of them but he's a
smart Brother who's worth hearing.
PATRICE
Are you Down for The Liberation of
Black People?
RON STALLWORTH
Do we always have to talk about
Politics?
PATRICE
What's more important?
RON STALLWORTH
You ever take any time off from The
Black Revolution?
PATRICE
I, We can't afford too.
Ron reaches across the table and takes Patrice's Hand.
Patrice pulls her Hand back.
RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
Angela Davis, can we spend some
quality time together.
PATRICE
And what did you say your J-O-B is?
RON STALLWORTH
Kathleen Cleaver, I didn't?
PATRICE
Are You A Pig?
RON STALLWORTH
You mean A Cop?
You A Cop?

PATRICE

RON STALLWORTH
NO!!! I'm a Black Man who wants to
get to know A Strong, Intelligent,
Beautiful Sista.

Suddenly...
The Undercover Line rings. Ron freezes. Picks up the line.
This is Ron.

RON STALLWORTH

KEN (O.S.)
This is Ken. This is Ron? Your Voice
sounds different over The Phone.
Ron has to THINK FAST.
RON STALLWORTH
Allergies acting up again.
A steady Beat of Silence on The Line. Then...
KEN (O.S.)
...Yeah, I get that all the time.
Ron waits for the response.
KEN (O.S.)(CONT'D)
Well, just thought I'd say it was
great having you swing by. The
Brothers really took a liking to you.
Ron squeezes his fist. Victory. Trying to stay nonchalant:

INT. CSPD HALLWAY - DAY

Sgt. Trapp and Ron walk and talk.
SGT. TRAPP
Looks like the thing all these Racist
Groups want now, including the Klan,
is to become Mainstream.
Really.

RON STALLWORTH

49.
SGT. TRAPP
I've got a friend keeps up with these
Groups. He says they're moving away
from the Ole Violent Racist style.
That's what Duke is peddling now.
Duke?

RON STALLWORTH

SGT. TRAPP
David Duke current Grand Wizard of
The Klan but he's clearly got his
Sights on Higher Office.
RON STALLWORTH
Political Office? How so?
SGT. TRAPP
Yeah, I guess they're trying to move
away from Selling Hate and moving
toward Selling Grievance.
Keep going.

RON STALLWORTH

SGT. TRAPP
Affirmative Action, Immigration,
Crime, Tax Reform, Welfare Cheats. He
said no one wants to be called a
Bigot anymore. Archie Bunker made
that too Un-Cool. The idea is in the
guise of all these issues, everyday
Americans can accept it, support it,
until eventually, one day, you get
somebody in The White House that
embodies it.
RON STALLWORTH
America would never elect somebody
like David Duke President of the
United States of America?
Sgt. Trapp just stares at Ron for a long moment.
SGT. TRAPP
For a Black Man, you're pretty naive.

Noise.
The Klansmen Feed off The Energy.
BUTCH (CONT'D)
Make 'em remember who We Are and What
We Stand For.
LOUISE
I read in The Gazette some Nigger
named Carmichael held a Rally and
there's some College Nigger Girl
Patrice Dumas with the "Baboon

This Black Bitch is Dangerous.
Reminds me of that Commie Angela
Davis. We need to shut her mouth.
The Men exchange uneasy looks - Why is Louise in Men's
Business?

63

52.
LOUISE (CONT'D)
Here, I clipped the Article.
Louise pulls The Article from her apron. Hands it to Butch.
Butch eyes it, focused on an image of Kwame and without
looking up...
BUTCH
That'll be all. Love you Sweetie.
LOUISE
One of these days you're going to
need me to do something for you. Wait
and See.
Louise trudges out of the Living Room without answering.
Butch hands The Clipping to The Klansmen, who pass it around
the room. When it reaches Ken, he sets it down.
KEN
How 'bout We focus on our Bread and
Butter. The Next Cross Burning.

BUTCH (CONT'D)

Chuck Freezes. Butch's Finger Rests on The Trigger.
Teasingly? Seriously? Butch stares, challenging Chuck to make
a Move. Any Move.
CHUCK
That's a Remington Model 1900.
A long Beat. Then: Butch smiles.

Yup. Does that kinda' Shit all the

Patrice. Yeah.
CHUCK

Relationship.
RON STALLWORTH
You're right, I'm messin' up. Hate to
violate that Blue Wall of Silence.
Chuck has no response to that.
CHUCK
Well, Butch noticed her at your
place. And they hate her guts.
RON STALLWORTH
Is she a Target?
CHUCK
I don't know. Maybe.
Ron goes quiet, concerned.
CHUCK
And don't let Chief know about
Patrice! He won't like it either.
Just how far do you plan to take
this?
RON STALLWORTH
Far as I can. Far as Chief let's me.

CHUCK

CHUCK (CONT'D)
I've been working Undercover a long
time. Nothing ever bothered me
before... this does.
RON STALLWORTH
Hey, Man, it gets me too. Bad.
CHUCK
You know, when Butch had me in that
room and I kept having to deny I was
Jewish. It made me think.
Chuck looks at Ron.
CHUCK (CONT'D)
I have been passing.
Ron listens.
CHUCK (CONT'D)
See, my, Parents split up when I was
a Kid and My mother kinda fell away
from things. So I never thought much
about being Jewish. I was always just
another White Kid.
Ron continues to listen.
CHUCK (CONT'D)
My Grandfather survived Buckenwald.
RON STALLWORTH
I'm sorry to hear.
CHUCK
He passed away a couple years ago.
Ron understands the weight of this.
CHUCK (CONT'D)
And every time that fuckin' Butch
made me deny I was Jewish... I
thought of him.
Chuck looks up at Ron his eyes full of Anger and Hurt.

Me?

PATRICE

RON STALLWORTH
You've been outspoken about the
incident with the Police when Kwame
was here.
PATRICE
So the next time they'll have a
Burning Cross out Front.
RON STALLWORTH
They're trying to get to you. Don't
let them in. Like you said they want
to intimidate make themselves feared.
If you don't let 'em scare you. They
got nothing. But keep your eyes open.
Be Cool.
HAKIM
That's the problem we've been too
Cool!
LEON
Way too Cool!
RON STALLWORTH
Maybe the both of you should call The
Cops.
HAKIM
How we know this ain't some of the
KKK's Honky-Pig-Partners passing out
this Shit!
Patrice and Ron step away from the guys. They walk and talk.
PATRICE
Leon and Hakim have Big Mouths.

Duane's eyes light up.
CHUCK (CONT'D)

INT. RON'S DESK - CSPD INTELLIGENCE UNIT - NIGHT
It's late. Ron's on the phone in mid-conversation. It is
intercut with David Duke speaking on the sofa in his office:
DAVID DUKE
...I don't share this with many
people, but My family had a Black
Housekeeper growing up. Her name was
Pinky. She was probably the closest
Woman to me other than Mother.
RON STALLWORTH
That surprises me.
DAVID DUKE
I know. People think I hate Black
People. I don't and the Klan doesn't.
Ron gives a "This Is Crazy!" Look.
DAVID DUKE
They just need to be with their own.
That's what Pinky would say, she had
no problem with Segregation because
she wanted to be with her own kind.
RON STALLWORTH
Sounds like she was a Mammy to you.
DAVID DUKE
She was. You ever see "Gone with the
Wind." That's the relationship I had
with Pinky.
RON STALLWORTH
You were Scarlett and she was Mammy.
DAVID DUKE
That's right. When she died it was
like we lost one of the Family.
RON STALLWORTH
A good Nigger's funny that way. In
that sense they're like a dog. They
can get real close to you and when
you lose em'. Just breaks your heart.

96

77.
DAVID DUKE
Well said Ron.
RON STALLWORTH
I knew a Nigger once.
Yeah.

DAVID DUKE

RON STALLWORTH
Yeah. He lived across the street from
us. I must of been Six or Seven. His
name was Willie. Me and Willie played
together everyday. One day My Father
came home early from work and told me
I couldn't play with Willie anymore
because I was White and Willie was a
Nigger.
Duke laughs.
That's rich.

DAVID DUKE

Ron's face reveals the story is probably true, but reversed.
Ain't it.

RON STALLWORTH

DAVID DUKE
Well, you're an upstanding White
Christian Man. I tell you this is why
we need more people like us in Public
Office. To get this Country back on
Track.
Amen.

RON STALLWORTH

DAVID DUKE
For America to Achieve our Greatness
again.
RON STALLWORTH
Absolutely. Sure wish we had the
chance to chat Face to Face.
DAVID DUKE
In due time my friend. I'll be in
Colorado Springs for your
initiation...

Elections coming up next month, I
don't think I'd carry The Vote.
The Vote...?

RON STALLWORTH

KEN (O.S.)
We need a new Leader. Someone
everyone can unite behind. Butch
would Love to be The One but we can't
let that happen. He's a Crazy Son Of
A Bitch. A Loose Cannon. We need
someone Articulate, who displays
Great Leadership qualities... It
should be you, Ron. You should be
Chapter President.
Ron sits there a moment, unable to say a word. After he
composes himself:
RON STALLWORTH
That's quite an Honor.
KEN (O.S.)
You will be a Great Chapter
President.
RON STALLWORTH
I 'm having to visit my sick Father

Members exchanged looks. Butch can't hide his smile.
KEN (CONT'D)
I'd like to make a nomination...
Mr. Ron Stallworth for Chapter
President.
The Room is Silent.
BUTCH
We just met this Guy.
DUANE
He just walked in off the street.

80.
BUTCH
Let me ask a question. Is there
anybody in this House that is willing
to put their Neck on the Line for
Ron?
KEN
I will vouch for Ron.
All eyes turn to Chuck.
CHUCK
It's a Big Honor but I can't accept.

RON STALLWORTH
I'm anxious to meet you and it will
be something I share with my Family
for Generations to come.
INTERCUT RON AND SGT. TRAPP WITH DAVID DUKE AT HIS DESK:
DAVID DUKE
I'm eager to meet you too, Ron.
Ron and Sgt. Trapp make eye contact. Sgt. Trapp nods, a laugh
threatening to spring out of his Face.
RON STALLWORTH
Say, Mr. Duke... I just have to ask.
Aren't you ever concerned about some
Smart-Aleck Negro calling you and
pretending to be White?
Sgt. Trapp covers his Mouth.
DAVID DUKE
No, I can always tell when I'm
talking to a Negro.
How so?

RON STALLWORTH

82.
DAVID DUKE
Take you, for example. I can tell you
are a pure Aryan White Man by the way
you pronounce certain words.
Sgt. Trapp is doubled over now.
RON STALLWORTH
Any examples?
DAVID DUKE
Take the word "are". A pure Aryan
like you or I would say it
correctly... like "are". Negroes
pronounce it "are-uh".
RON STALLWORTH
You are so White... Right. I want to
thank you for this Lesson because if
you had not brought it to my
attention, I would never have noticed
the difference between how We talk
and how Negroes talk.
Sgt. Trapp is laughing so hard he is shaking violently. He
shakes his head as if to implore Ron to stop.
RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
From now on I'm going to pay close
attention to my Telephone
conversations so I can make sure I'm
not talking to one of dem' Sneaky
Coloreds.
Ron cups The Receiver, looks at Sgt. Trapp, whispers.
You okay?

RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)

Sgt. Trapp gets up and bumbles away. Ron speaks into The
Phone:
RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
I would love to continue this
conversation when you are in Colorado
Springs. Beautiful here, Sir. God's
Country.
DAVID DUKE
That's what I've heard, Ron. You have

Ron hangs up, laughing. He calls to Sgt. Trapp:

Hello?

Butch stands underneath a single hanging Light-Bulb.

CHUCK

caliber and hands it to Chuck.

RON STALLWORTH
Black Panthers, Progressive Labor
Party. Everywhere Duke goes they'll

CHUCK
Butch wants a fight of some kind.
RON STALLWORTH
I don't think any of the Anti-Klan
Protesters would go that far.
CHUCK
I don't know, what's Patrice saying?
RON STALLWORTH
What, I'm like suppose to be spying
on her.
CHUCK
It's what we do.
RON STALLWORTH
She's not under investigation!
Chuck is frustrated, goes quiet, then tries to understand.
CHUCK
You worried about her?
RON STALLWORTH
How can I not be?
Chuck lifts up his shirt revealing Butch's Handgun.
CHUCK (CONT'D)
Butch gave it to me. We get them on
Weapons Charges. Prevent them from
trying anything. It's the best way to
protect her.
RON STALLWORTH
...Then what? They're off on a
misdemeanor, Free to plan their next
move?

86.
Chuck sighs, frustrated.
CHUCK
It's gotta be the March. They're

You need to give me something else.
If there's gonna be an Attack, I need

Ron and Patrice are going at it as across the street The
Freedom House Protestors assemble to March on the KKK.
RON STALLWORTH
You can hate me, think I'm a Damn
Fool, whatever. Just promise me you
won't go to The Protest.
PATRICE
I'm going. The Black Student Union is
going too.
RON STALLWORTH
I can't say specifics but I know the
Klan is planning an Attack. Today.
PATRICE
Then we have to tell The People.
RON STALLWORTH
No. No one can know while it's an
Active Investigation...

111

89.
PATRICE
Active Investigation?
RON STALLWORTH
...Confidentially... The KKK has
Explosives.
PATRICE
How do you know all this? You a Cop?
RON STALLWORTH
I'm not a Cop.
Silence.
PATRICE
What are you, then?...
Ron takes a moment. Then...
RON STALLWORTH
...I'm a Undercover Detective. I've
been investigating The KKK.
PATRICE
You lied to me.
RON STALLWORTH
I know, but... it's beside the point.
We think there's a chance they're
gonna, set a Bomb off at Today's
Event.
PATRICE
Then I need to tell The Protesters.
RON STALLWORTH
The Klan can't know that we know. We
think they wanna start something,
like a Race War. Remember Kwame? We
both stood there and listened while
he predicted this Shit.
PATRICE
I take my Duties as President Of The
Black Student Union seriously.
RON STALLWORTH
All the good it does. You could sit
in the middle of Nevada Avenue and
set yourself on Fire and The KKK will
still be here.
PATRICE
I'd be doing something. Unlike you.

90.
RON STALLWORTH
Unlike? Don't think because I'm not
wearing a Black Beret, Black Leather
Jacket and Black Ray Bans screaming
"KILL WHITEY" doesn't mean I don't
care about my People.
Patrice takes this in.
PATRICE
That night we saw Kwame... were you
Undercover then too?
Patrice...

RON STALLWORTH

PATRICE
...Answer the question. Were you
Undercover The Night we met?
Ron is silent.
PATRICE
Are you for The Liberation of Black
People?
RON STALLWORTH
I'm a Undercover Detective for The
Colorado Springs Police Department.
It's my J-O-B.

Sgt. Trapp and Chuck who have been standing there, listening.
RON STALLWORTH
Butch just said the March was
cancelled.
What! Why?

CHUCK

All Ron can do is shake his head. He paces, concerned.
SGT. TRAPP
Could it be all the Death Threats?
RON STALLWORTH
No, they're use to that.
CHUCK
Convenient how the March got called
off and Patrice is safe now.
Ron stops pacing, Chuck looks at him, sarcastic.
RON STALLWORTH
What? I got the Klan to call off the
March to protect her.
CHUCK
Yeah, and now we don't know where or
who is the target!
RON STALLWORTH
This is all Butch! He called off the
March because he's going to War. He
could attack anybody at anytime!
Chief Taggert walks in unexpectedly with Sgt. Morris.
Everyone snaps up, respectful.
CHIEF TAGGERT (CONT'D)
I have a Special Assignment for Ron.
SGT. TRAPP
Ron already has an assignment.
RON STALLWORTH
What's more important than preventing
an Attack?

Chief Taggert hands Ron "The David Duke Death Threat Fax."
CHIEF TAGGERT
Because of the very credible threats
to David Duke's Life here in Colorado
Springs, I would like that he be
given a Security Detail while he
visits our City.
RON STALLWORTH
What's this have to do with me?
CHIEF TAGGERT
You're gonna be David Duke's
Bodyguard.
A Shockwave.
RON STALLWORTH
I don't think that's a wise
decision...
SGT. MORRIS
...Duke needs protection. There's no
one else available.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Ron, it's Nut Cracking Time. Put your
Personal Politics aside.
RON STALLWORTH
It's not about that and you know it.
David Duke and I have been speaking
over the phone, several times. If he
recognizes my voice... or if any of
the Klansmen do, it could compromise
The Entire Investigation... A
Clusterfuck.
CHIEF TAGGERT curls a smile.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't
you boast that you were fluent in
both English and Jive?
Ron is quiet.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Do you remember that?
SGT. MORRIS
Answer The Chief!
Ron goes at Sgt. Morris.

RON STALLWORTH
Man, who you think you're talking to.
You've been trying to sabotage me

CHIEF TAGGERT

SGT. MORRIS
Why you getting so worked up, Boy?
RON STALLWORTH

Chief raises his eyebrows from the comment. A pissed Sgt.
Morris turns to Chief Taggert for support but he says
nothing. Sgt. Morris, then Exits. Chief says to Ron.
CHIEF TAGGERT (CONT'D)
If you let him get to you that easy,
you ain't got a Shot with David Duke.

He carefully removes a large C4 Bomb from his gym bag.
WALKER
First, The Primary Target.
Walker speaks to Louise. He sets The Bomb on the work bench.
WALKER (CONT’D)
Butch says you’re placing it. So all
you have to do is set the bag on the
front porch, back porch, side wall,

against the building. You can place
it anywhere. There’s enough C4 here

Old Coon to speak. The place should

Smaller Bomb from the bag. He can hold it in one hand.
Plan B.

BUTCH

WALKER
For your Secondary target. It's small
enough to conceal in your purse.
Louise nods. Walker sets it on the bench speaking to Butch.
WALKER (CONT’D)

Correct.

BUTCH

Walker speaks again to Louise.
WALKER
Again, when you’re ready, Flip The
oggle. Place this inside The Mail
Box. In case there’s a problem, I’ve
attached a magnet to the back.
Walker turns it over pointing it out.
WALKER (CONT’D)
If for some reason you can’t

Gas Tank. That'll double the

Walker then takes out a Remote Control Detonator placing his
Thumb over The Button.

RON STALLWORTH
I'm Mr. Duke's Security Detail.
They look at each other, then back at Ron. They say nothing.
Just then Duke emerges from The Hotel, wearing a neatly
pressed Suit and Tie. He nods to the Bikers, then looks up at
the Plainclothes Black Detective in front of him.
Ron steps forward, extending a hand.

Duke gives Ron the most vicious look imaginable.
Ron stares back. It's a SHOWDOWN.

Boy you get ya' ass out NOW!

Louise drives up. She sits there for a long moment staring at
Patrice's House. Louise decides. She gets out of the Car
carrying her purse. She looks like an Avon lady coming to
call. She walks up on Patrice’s porch looking around. She
carefully sets
HER PURSE
down by a pillar on the porch and slowly removes the Bomb.
She opens the mailbox to place the Bomb. She nervously flips
the toggle switch when she sees...
PATRICE
drive up. Flustered, Louise grabs her purse to put the Bomb
back inside while looking at Patrice and friends getting out
of the car.
Patrice talks to Mr. Tompkins, not noticing her. Louise sets
the purse back down on the porch. Did she get the Bomb back
inside the purse? Louise quickly leaves the porch striding to
her car sweating, crazy nervous. Patrice, Mr. Tompkins and
Hakim are conversing entering the House.
LOUISE
briskly moves toward the rear of Patrice’s Car.
RON

The Two fight as she SCREAMS scratching and clawing at Ron.
The Fight moves from the Pick Up Truck as he throws her down
on the grass of a near by lawn, subduing the SCREAMING
Louise.
RON STALLWORTH (CONT’D)
Where is it!!!
Ron reaches back for his handcuffs...
Freeze!

Swartz and Burns look at each other, unsure.
RON STALLWORTH

CSPD OFFICER BURNS

Ron goes to reach in his pocket but the two Officers make
aggressive moves with their Guns! Ron catches himself! He
doesn’t want to get shot! He decides to just tell them.
RON STALLWORTH

drink looking very intimate. Ron sees something.
RON STALLWORTH
Jezzus Christ.
What?

PATRICE

RON STALLWORTH
Your Boyfriend.
Patrice turns and sees.
Oh My God.

PATRICE

Sgt. Morris nears them with a Beer in his hand.

SGT. MORRIS
Oh Yeah, Yeah, you looked good that
night but you look even better now.
PATRICE
How often do you do that to Black
People?
Do what?

SGT. MORRIS

PATRICE
Pull us over for nothing. Harass us.
Put your hands all over a Woman in
the guise of searching her. Call us
everything but A Child of God.
SGT. MORRIS
I don't know what you're talking
about.
RON STALLWORTH
It's like what I told you. He just
likes taking advantage but in the end
he's All Hat and No Cattle.
Sgt. Morris looks around then leans in close to Patrice and
Ron. He speaks softly issuing a deadly threat.
SGT. MORRIS
Let me tell you both something, I've
been keeping you People in line in
this City for years. What I did to
your Girl that night, I can do to any
of you, Anytime, Anyplace. That's my
prerogative. I can even Bust a Cap on
one of you if I feel like it, and
nuthin' will be done about it. Get
it? Wish the both of you got blown up
instead of Good White Folks.
Sgt. Morris raises up.
Oh I get it.

RON STALLWORTH

Ron looks at Patrice.
RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
You get it, Patrice?
PATRICE
Oh, I totally and completely get it?
Sgt. Morris looks confused with their response.

119.

Good.

RON STALLWORTH

Ron turns toward the Bar and shouts.
RON STALLWORTH (CONT'D)
You get it, Chuck?
Behind the Bar, Chuck leans out from the back room waving to
Ron wearing Headphones recording The Conversation.
CHUCK
Oh, We got it! We got it all!
Ron stands removing his Shirt revealing The Wire he is
wearing. Sgt. Morris is in shock.
RON STALLWORTH
You get it, Chief?
Sgt. Trapp appears taking the Beer from Sgt. Morris' hand
turning him around putting Handcuffs on him. Chief Taggert
comes from the back nearing Sgt. Morris. The two lock eyes.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Oh, I really, really get it. You're
under arrest for Police Misconduct,
Sexual Misconduct and Police
Brutality.
Sgt. Trapp and the Chief usher Sgt. Morris, who is babbling
like a Fool out of The Bar reading him his rights.

CHIEF TAGGERT
Not a Bad Legacy to leave.
Taggert takes a deliberate pause. Then, THE Sucker Punch...
CHIEF TAGGERT (CONT'D)

Evidence of The Investigation.
Excuse me?

SGT. TRAPP
Chief, are you sure that's necessary?

Ron is heated.
RON STALLWORTH
If they found out...
CHIEF TAGGERT
...Cease all further contact with The
Ku Klux Klan. Effective immediately.
That goes for Chuck too. Ron
Stallworth... The Klansman never
existed here in Colorado Springs.
RON STALLWORTH
This is some Fucked up Bullshit.
CHIEF TAGGERT
Take a week off. Go on vacation with

Ron storms out. Trapp follows.

We’re fed the same BS, it’s all okay,

Multiplies.
Just then. The Undercover Phone Line rings on Ron's desk.
Ron stares at the Phone, still ringing. He looks at The

Ron stops. Throws The Documents in a Folder. Sweeps some
Folders into his Briefcase. Leaves as The Phone still rings.

Nigger Detective who threatened me.
RON STALLWORTH
Goddamn Coloreds sure know how to

Chuck snorts. Ron holds in a Belly-Laugh.
DAVID DUKE
You can say that again.

Ron cracks up into his Hand. Sgt. Trapp is wheezing-- his
Face Bright Pink. Chuck is laughing hard in the background.
RON STALLWORTH
Can I ask you something? That Nigger
Detective who gave you a hard time?
Ever get his name?
No, I...

DAVID DUKE

RON STALLWORTH
...Are-uh you sure you don't know who
he is? Are-uh you absolutely sure?
Duke looks at his Phone. Ron puts his hand over The Receiver.
RON STALLWORTH
I can't do it Jackie. I'm not gonna'
kill myself. I can't die at 53.
Ron takes out his SMALL NOTE PAD out revealing a list of
Racial epitaphs he had written down being on this
Investigation. He reads from it to Duke on the phone.

PATRICE
My Conscience won't let me Sleep with

RON STALLWORTH
Your Enemy, this Cop, saved your

PATRICE
You're absolutely right. And I Thank
you for it.
Patrice kisses Ron Good Bye. WE HEAR The Door close.
He looks in the distance: The Rolling Hills surrounding The
Neighborhood lead towards Pike's Peak, which sits on the
horizon like a King on A Throne.
Then he sees it: Something Burning.
CLOSER-- WE SEE a CROSS being lit, its Flames dancing,
sending embers into The BLACK, Colorado Sky.
CUT TO BLACK.
